Are you sure you want to use a product that isn't documented properly in a production application? I wouldn't.\r\n\r\nNow, for .NET Core, there's even less documentation.

I found this helpful.  While it is about the Java version, Lucene.NET is an almost exact port to C#, so it is easy to use the concepts in you code.\r\n\r\nJust a warning, Lucene.NET 4.8 is .NET Standard 2.0 and can be easily used in a .NET Core application, but the API is different from the 3.0.3 version, which is not .NET Standard, only .NET Framework 4.6.\r\n\r\nHowever, you can include .NET 4.6 NuGet packages in a .NET Core app and in most cases, they will work fine.  I have not run into any issues, so you can ignore the warnings.\r\n\r\nJust remember, Lucene.NET is just a library to provide Inverted Indexes and Search functionality, but you have to implement the app and infrastructure that uses it.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of alternatives that leverage Lucene or Lucene.NET and provide a more complete solution.  ElasticSearch and RavenDb are just a couple.  Also, many CMS frameworks will include Lucene based Indexing and Search capabilities as modules.

Effectively, you have two problems you need to solve here; the first is how to search the pdf content and the second is how to write the chatbot.\r\n\r\nLet's start off with searching the pdf content. If I were tackling this, I would look to see if there was anything available that could actually read document content. Fortunately, there is; there are any number of services such as [] or [] that provide full text-search capabilities. So, that's one part solved.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I would be looking at is what resources are available to me to help me learn how to write a Chatbot. Chatbots are not something you should want to tackle without research, or dedicated libraries if you don't want to write natural language systems from scratch yourself. Fortunately, in Python, there are toolkits such as the NLTK available which you should be able to leverage.\r\nPete O'Hanlon12-Nov-19 7:47am"]},
