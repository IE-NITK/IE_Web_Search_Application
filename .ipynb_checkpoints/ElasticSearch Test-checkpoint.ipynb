       "      'Since this answer has become rather popular, I\\'m rewriting it significantly.Let\\'s not forget the actual question that was asked:How to remove the space between ? I was hoping\\n  for a CSS solution that doesn\\'t require the HTML source code to be\\n  tampered with. It  possible to solve this problem with CSS alone, but there are no  robust CSS fixes.The solution I had in my initial answer was to add font-size: 0 to the parent element, and then declare a sensible font-size on the children.This works in recent versions of all modern browsers. It works in IE8. It does not work in Safari 5, but it  work in Safari 6. Safari 5 is nearly a dead browser ().Most of the possible issues with relative font sizes are not complicated to fix.However, while this is a reasonable solution if you  a CSS only fix, it\\'s not what I recommend if you\\'re free to change your HTML (as most of us are).This is what I, as a reasonably experienced web developer, actually do to solve this problem:<p>\\n    <span>Foo</span><span>Bar</span>\\n</p>\\nYes, that\\'s right. I remove the whitespace in the HTML between the inline-block elements.It\\'s easy. It\\'s simple. It works everywhere. It\\'s the pragmatic solution.You do sometimes have to carefully consider where whitespace will come from.  No, not if you do it properly.Let\\'s go on a magical journey of different ways to remove the whitespace, with some new HTML:<ul>\\n    <li>Item 1</li>\\n    <li>Item 2</li>\\n    <li>Item 3</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nYou can do this, as I usually do:<ul>\\n    <li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nOr, this:<ul>\\n    <li>Item 1</li\\n    ><li>Item 2</li\\n    ><li>Item 3</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nOr, use comments:<ul>\\n    <li>Item 1</li><!--\\n    --><li>Item 2</li><!--\\n    --><li>Item 3</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nOr, if you are using using PHP or similar:<ul>\\n    <li>Item 1</li><?\\n    ?><li>Item 2</li><?\\n    ?><li>Item 3</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\nOr,  even skip  closing tags entirely (all browsers are fine with this):<ul>\\n    <li>Item 1\\n    <li>Item 2\\n    <li>Item 3\\n</ul>\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve gone and bored you to death with \"one thousand different ways to remove whitespace, by thirtydot\", hopefully you\\'ve forgotten all about font-size: 0.Alternatively, you  to achieve many of the layouts that you may previously have used inline-block for: ',\n",

       "      \"Most answers here fail to explain what the actual problem with slicing is. They only explain the benign cases of slicing, not the treacherous ones. Assume, like the other answers, that you're dealing with two classes A and B, where B derives (publicly) from A.In this situation, C++ lets you pass an instance of B to  A's assignment operator (and also to the copy constructor). This works because an instance of B can be converted to a const A&, which is what assignment operators and copy-constructors expect their arguments to be.B b;\\nA a = b;\\nNothing bad happens there - you asked for an instance of A which is a copy of B, and that's exactly what you get. Sure, a won't contain some of b's members, but how should it? It's an A, after all, not a B, so it hasn't even  about these members, let alone would be able to store them.B b1;\\nB b2;\\nA& a_ref = b2;\\na_ref = b1;\\n//b2 now contains a mixture of b1 and b2!\\nYou might think that b2 will be a copy of b1 afterward. But, alas, it's ! If you inspect it, you'll discover that b2 is a Frankensteinian creature, made from some chunks of b1 (the chunks that B inherits from A), and some chunks of b2 (the chunks that only B contains). Ouch!What happened? Well, C++ by default doesn't treat assignment operators as virtual. Thus, the line a_ref = b1 will call the assignment operator of A, not that of B. This is because, for non-virtual functions, the  (formally: ) type (which is A&) determines which function is called, as opposed to the  (formally: ) type (which would be B, since a_ref references an instance of B). Now, A's assignment operator obviously knows only about the members declared in A, so it will copy only those, leaving the members added in B unchanged.Assigning only to parts of an object usually makes little sense, yet C++, unfortunately, provides no built-in way to forbid this. You can, however, roll your own. The first step is making the assignment operator . This will guarantee that it's always the  type's assignment operator which is called, not the  type's. The second step is to use dynamic_cast to verify that the assigned object has a compatible type. The third step is to do the actual assignment in a (protected!) member assign(), since B's assign() will probably want to use A's assign() to copy A's, members.class A {\\npublic:\\n  virtual A& operator= (const A& a) {\\n    assign(a);\\n    return *this;\\n  }\\n\\nprotected:\\n  void assign(const A& a) {\\n    // copy members of A from a to this\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nclass B : public A {\\npublic:\\n  virtual B& operator= (const A& a) {\\n    if (const B* b = dynamic_cast<const B*>(&a))\\n      assign(*b);\\n    else\\n      throw bad_assignment();\\n    return *this;\\n  }\\n\\nprotected:\\n  void assign(const B& b) {\\n    A::assign(b); // Let A's assign() copy members of A from b to this\\n    // copy members of B from b to this\\n  }\\n};\\nNote that, for pure convenience, B's operator= covariantly overrides the return type, since it  that it's returning an instance of B.\",\n",

Then you have to unpack the data.Here\\'s how it looks with the above example, written in SQLSELECT id, \\n       CAST(SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 2 FOR 6) AS float) as max_rev,\\n       SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 11) AS content_for_max_rev \\nFROM  (SELECT id, \\n       CAST(1000 + rev + .001 as CHAR) || \\'---\\' || CAST(content AS char) AS packed_col\\n       FROM yourtable\\n      ) \\nGROUP BY id\\nThe packing begins by forcing the  column to be a number of known character length regardless of the value of  so that for example\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you do it right, string comparison of two numbers should yield the same \"max\" as numeric comparison of the two numbers and it\\'s easy to convert back to the original number using the substring function (which is available in one form or another pretty much everywhere).',\n",

       "      'Variables have a limited \"scope\", or \"places from which they are accessible\". Just because you wrote $foo = \\'bar\\'; once  in your application doesn\\'t mean you can refer to $foo from  else inside the application. The variable $foo has a certain scope within which it is valid and only code in the same scope has access to the variable.Very simple: PHP has . That\\'s the only kind of scope separator that exists in PHP. Variables inside a function are only available inside that function. Variables outside of functions are available anywhere outside of functions, but not inside any function. This means there\\'s one special scope in PHP: the  scope. Any variable declared outside of any function is within this global scope.<?php\\n\\n$foo = \\'bar\\';\\n\\nfunction myFunc() {\\n    $baz = 42;\\n}\\n$foo is in the  scope, $baz is in a  scope inside myFunc. Only code inside myFunc has access to $baz. Only code  myFunc has access to $foo. Neither has access to the other:<?php\\n\\n$foo = \\'bar\\';\\n\\nfunction myFunc() {\\n    $baz = 42;\\n\\n    echo $foo;  // doesn\\'t work\\n    echo $baz;  // works\\n}\\n\\necho $foo;  // works\\necho $baz;  // doesn\\'t work\\nFile boundaries do  scope:<?php\\n\\n$foo = \\'bar\\';\\n<?php\\n\\ninclude \\'a.php\\';\\n\\necho $foo;  // works!\\nThe same rules apply to included code as applies to any other code: only functions separate scope. For the purpose of scope, you may think of including files like copy and pasting code:<?php\\n\\nfunction myFunc() {\\n    include \\'a.php\\';\\n\\n    echo $foo;  // works\\n}\\n\\nmyFunc();\\n\\necho $foo;  // doesn\\'t work!\\nIn the above example, a.php was included inside myFunc, any variables inside a.php only have local function scope. Just because they  to be in the global scope in a.php doesn\\'t necessarily mean they are, it actually depends on which context that code is included/executed in.Every new function declaration introduces a new scope, it\\'s that simple.function foo() {\\n    $foo = \\'bar\\';\\n\\n    $bar = function () {\\n        // no access to $foo\\n        $baz = \\'baz\\';\\n    };\\n\\n    // no access to $baz\\n}\\n$foo = \\'foo\\';\\n\\nclass Bar {\\n\\n    public function baz() {\\n        // no access to $foo\\n        $baz = \\'baz\\';\\n    }\\n\\n}\\n\\n// no access to $baz\\nDealing with scoping issues may seem annoying, but  If every variable you declare would be available from everywhere else inside your application, you\\'d be stepping all over your variables with no real way to track what changes what. There are only so many sensible names you can give to your variables, you probably want to use the variable \"$name\" in more than one place. If you could only have this unique variable name once in your app, you\\'d have to resort to really complicated naming schemes to make sure your variables are unique and that you\\'re not changing the wrong variable from the wrong piece of code.Observe:function foo() {\\n    echo $bar;\\n}\\nIf there was no scope, what would the above function do? Where does $bar come from? What state does it have? Is it even initialized? Do you have to check every time? This is not maintainable. Which brings us to...function foo($bar) {\\n    echo $bar;\\n    return 42;\\n}\\nThe variable $bar is explicitly coming into this scope as function argument. Just looking at this function it\\'s clear where the values it works with originate from. It then explicitly  a value. The caller has the confidence to know what variables the function will work with and where its return values come from:$baz   = \\'baz\\';\\n$blarg = foo($baz);\\n$foo = \\'bar\\';\\n\\n$baz = function () use ($foo) {\\n    echo $foo;\\n};\\n\\n$baz();\\nThe anonymous function explicitly includes $foo from its surrounding scope. Note that this is not the same as  scope.globalAs said before, the global scope is somewhat special, and functions can explicitly import variables from it:$foo = \\'bar\\';\\n\\nfunction baz() {\\n    global $foo;\\n    echo $foo;\\n    $foo = \\'baz\\';\\n}\\nThis function uses and modifies the global variable $foo.  All the caller of this function sees is this:baz(); // outputs \"bar\"\\nunset($foo);\\nbaz(); // no output, WTF?!\\nbaz(); // outputs \"baz\", WTF?!?!!\\nThere\\'s no indication that this function has any , yet it does. This very easily becomes a tangled mess as some functions keep modifying  some global state. You want functions to be , acting only on their inputs and returning defined output, however many times you call them.You should avoid using the global scope in any way as much as possible; most certainly you should not be \"pulling\" variables out of the global scope into a local scope.',\n",
       "      'Although variables defined inside of a function\\'s scope can not be accessed from the outside that does not mean you can not use their values after that function completes. PHP has a well known static keyword that is widely used in object-oriented PHP for defining static methods and properties but one should keep in mind that static may also be used inside functions to define static variables.Static variable differs from ordinary variable defined in function\\'s scope in case that it does not loose value when program execution leaves this scope. Let\\'s consider the following example of using static variables:function countSheep($num) {\\n static $counter = 0;\\n $counter += $num;\\n echo \"$counter sheep jumped over fence\";\\n}\\n\\ncountSheep(1);\\ncountSheep(2);\\ncountSheep(3);\\nResult:1 sheep jumped over fence\\n3 sheep jumped over fence\\n6 sheep jumped over fence\\nIf we\\'d defined $counter without static then each time echoed value would be the same as $num parameter passed to the function. Using static allows to build this simple counter without additional workaround.Static variable exists only in a local function scope. It can not be\\n    accessed outside of the function it has been defined in. So you may \\n    be sure that it will keep its value unchanged until the next call to\\n    that function.Static variable may only be defined as a scalar or as a scalar \\n    expression (since PHP 5.6). Assigning other values to it inevitably \\n    leads to a failure at least at the moment this article was written.\\nNevertheless you are able to do so just on the next line of your code:function countSheep($num) {\\n  static $counter = 0;\\n  $counter += sqrt($num);//imagine we need to take root of our sheep each time\\n  echo \"$counter sheep jumped over fence\";\\n}\\nResult:2 sheep jumped over fence\\n5 sheep jumped over fence\\n9 sheep jumped over fence\\nStatic function is kinda \\'shared\\' between methods of objects of the\\n    same class. It is easy to understand by viewing the following example:class SomeClass {\\n  public function foo() {\\n    static $x = 0;\\n    echo ++$x;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n$object1 = new SomeClass;\\n$object2 = new SomeClass;\\n\\n$object1->foo(); // 1\\n$object2->foo(); // 2 oops, $object2 uses the same static $x as $object1\\n$object1->foo(); // 3 now $object1 increments $x\\n$object2->foo(); // 4 and now his twin brother\\nThis only works with objects of the same class. If objects are from different classes (even extending one another) behavior of static vars will be as expected.Another way to keep values between function calls is to use closures. Closures were introduced in PHP 5.3. In two words they allow you to limit access to some set of variables within a function scope to another anonymous function that will be the only way to access them. Being in closure variables may imitate (more or less successfully) OOP concepts like \\'class constants\\' (if they were passed in closure by value) or \\'private properties\\' (if passed by reference) in structured programming.The latter actually allows to use closures instead of static variables. What to use is always up to developer to decide but it should be mentioned that static variables are definitely useful when working with recursions and deserve to be noticed by devs.',\n",

So far so good. Moving on to sequence points. An alternation definition of seq-points given by the comp.lang.c author Steve Summit:Sequence point is a point in time at which the dust has settled and all side effects which have been seen so far are guaranteed to be complete.Those are:\\nat the end of the evaluation of full expression (§1.9/16) (A full-expression is an expression that is not a subexpression of another expression.)Example :int a = 5; // ; is a sequence point here\\n\\nin the evaluation of each of the following expressions after the evaluation of the first expression (§1.9/18) \\na && b (§5.14)\\na || b (§5.15)\\na ? b : c (§5.16)\\na , b (§5.18)func(a,a++),aa++a\\n\\nat a function call (whether or not the function is inline), after the evaluation of all function arguments (if any) which \\ntakes place before execution of any expressions or statements in the function body (§1.9/17).\\nThe Standard defines Undefined Behaviour in Section §1.3.12 asbehavior, such as might arise upon use of an erroneous program construct or erroneous data, for which this International Standard imposes .Undefined  behavior  may  also  be  expected  when  this\\n  International Standard omits the description of any explicit definition of behavior.In short, undefined behaviour means  can happen from daemons flying out of your nose to  your girlfriend getting pregnant.Before I get into that you must know the difference(s) between .You must also know that the order of evaluation of operands of individual operators and subexpressions of individual expressions, and the order in which side effects take place, is unspecified.For example:int x = 5, y = 6;\\n\\nint z = x++ + y++; //it is unspecified whether x++ or y++ will be evaluated first.\\nAnother example .Now the Standard in §5/4 says\\n\\nWhat does it mean?Informally it means that between two sequence points a variable must not be modified more than once.\\nIn an expression statement, the next sequence point is usually at the terminating semicolon, and the previous sequence point is at the end of the previous statement. An expression may also contain intermediate sequence points.From the above sentence the following expressions invoke Undefined Behaviour:i++ * ++i;   // UB, i is modified more than once btw two SPs\\ni = ++i;     // UB, same as above\\n++i = 2;     // UB, same as above\\ni = ++i + 1; // UB, same as above\\n++++++i;     // UB, parsed as (++(++(++i)))\\n\\ni = (i, ++i, ++i); // UB, there\\'s no SP between `++i` (right most) and assignment to `i` (`i` is modified more than once btw two SPs)\\nBut the following expressions are fine:i = (i, ++i, 1) + 1; // well defined (AFAIK)\\ni = (++i, i++, i);   // well defined \\nint j = i;\\nj = (++i, i++, j*i); // well defined\\n\\n\\nWhat does it mean? It means if an object is written to within a full expression, any and all accesses to it within the same expression . For example in i = i + 1 all the access of i (in L.H.S and in R.H.S) are  of the value to be written. So it is fine.This rule effectively constrains legal expressions to those in which the accesses demonstrably precede the modification.Example 1:std::printf(\"%d %d\", i,++i); // invokes Undefined Behaviour because of Rule no 2\\nExample 2:a[i] = i++ // or a[++i] = i or a[i++] = ++i etc\\nis disallowed because one of the accesses of i (the one in a[i]) has nothing to do with the value which ends up being stored in i (which happens over in i++), and so there\\'s no good way to define--either for our understanding or the compiler\\'s--whether the access should take place before or after the incremented value is stored. So the behaviour is undefined.Example 3 :int x = i + i++ ;// Similar to above\\n ',\n",

So, for simplicity and without actual loss of generality, say you have T sublists of k items each: the first k items are copied back and forth T-1 times, the second k items T-2 times, and so on; total number of copies is k times the sum of x for x from 1 to T excluded, i.e., k * (T**2)/2.The list comprehension just generates one list, once, and copies each item over (from its original place of residence to the result list) also exactly once.\",\n",

       "      'The most important part is the concepts. Once you understand how the building blocks work, differences in syntax amount to little more than mild dialects. A layer on top of your regular expression engine\\'s syntax is the syntax of the programming language you\\'re using. Languages such as Perl remove most of this complication, but you\\'ll have to keep in mind other considerations if you\\'re using regular expressions in a C program.If you think of regular expressions as building blocks that you can mix and match as you please, it helps you learn how to write and debug your own patterns but also how to understand patterns written by others.Conceptually, the simplest regular expressions are literal characters. The pattern N matches the character \\'N\\'.Regular expressions next to each other match sequences. For example, the pattern Nick matches the sequence \\'N\\' followed by \\'i\\' followed by \\'c\\' followed by \\'k\\'.If you\\'ve ever used grep on Unix—even if only to search for ordinary looking strings—you\\'ve already been using regular expressions! (The re in grep refers to regular expressions.)Adding just a little complexity, you can match either \\'Nick\\' or \\'nick\\' with the pattern [Nn]ick. The part in square brackets is a , which means it matches exactly one of the enclosed characters. You can also use ranges in character classes, so [a-c] matches either \\'a\\' or \\'b\\' or \\'c\\'.The pattern . is special: rather than matching a literal dot only, it matches  character. It\\'s the same conceptually as the really big character class [-.?+%$A-Za-z0-9...].Think of character classes as menus: pick just one.Using . can save you lots of typing, and there are other shortcuts for common patterns. Say you want to match a digit: one way to write that is [0-9]. Digits are a frequent match target, so you could instead use the shortcut \\\\d. Others are \\\\s (whitespace) and \\\\w (word characters: alphanumerics or underscore).The uppercased variants are their complements, so \\\\S matches any -whitespace character, for example.From there, you can repeat parts of your pattern with . For example, the pattern ab?c matches \\'abc\\' or \\'ac\\' because the ? quantifier makes the subpattern it modifies optional. Other quantifiers are\\n*\\n+\\n{n}\\n{n,}\\n{n,m}\\nPutting some of these blocks together, the pattern [Nn]*ick matches all of\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first match demonstrates an important lesson: * Any pattern can match zero times.A few other useful examples:\\n[0-9]+\\\\d+\\n\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}\\nA quantifier modifies the pattern to its immediate left. You might expect 0abc+0 to match \\'0abc0\\', \\'0abcabc0\\', and so forth, but the pattern  to the left of the plus quantifier is c. This means 0abc+0 matches \\'0abc0\\', \\'0abcc0\\', \\'0abccc0\\', and so on.To match one or more sequences of \\'abc\\' with zeros on the ends, use 0(abc)+0. The parentheses denote a subpattern that can be quantified as a unit. It\\'s also common for regular expression engines to save or \"capture\" the portion of the input text that matches a parenthesized group. Extracting bits this way is much more flexible and less error-prone than counting indices and substr.Earlier, we saw one way to match either \\'Nick\\' or \\'nick\\'. Another is with alternation as in Nick|nick. Remember that alternation includes everything to its left and everything to its right. Use grouping parentheses to limit the scope of |, , (Nick|nick).For another example, you could equivalently write [a-c] as a|b|c, but this is likely to be suboptimal because many implementations assume alternatives will have lengths greater than 1.Although some characters match themselves, others have special meanings. The pattern \\\\d+ doesn\\'t match backslash followed by lowercase D followed by a plus sign: to get that, we\\'d use \\\\\\\\d\\\\+. A backslash removes the special meaning from the following character.Regular expression quantifiers are greedy. This means they match as much text as they possibly can while allowing the entire pattern to match successfully.For example, say the input is\"Hello,\" she said, \"How are you?\"You might expect \".+\" to match only \\'Hello,\\' and will then be surprised when you see that it matched from \\'Hello\\' all the way through \\'you?\\'.To switch from greedy to what you might think of as cautious, add an extra ? to the quantifier. Now you understand how \\\\((.+?)\\\\), the example from your question works. It matches the sequence of a literal left-parenthesis, followed by one or more characters, and terminated by a right-parenthesis.If your input is \\'(123) (456)\\', then the first capture will be \\'123\\'. Non-greedy quantifiers want to allow the rest of the pattern to start matching as soon as possible.(As to your confusion, I don\\'t know of any regular-expression dialect where ((.+?)) would do the same thing. I suspect something got lost in transmission somewhere along the way.)Use the special pattern ^ to match only at the beginning of your input and $ to match only at the end. Making \"bookends\" with your patterns where you say, \"I know what\\'s at the front and back, but give me everything between\" is a useful technique.Say you want to match comments of the form-- This is a comment --you\\'d write ^--\\\\s+(.+)\\\\s+--$.Regular expressions are recursive, so now that you understand these basic rules, you can combine them however you like.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The statement above that . matches any character is a simplification for pedagogical purposes that is not strictly true. Dot matches any character except newline, \"\\\\n\", but in practice you rarely expect a pattern such as .+ to cross a newline boundary. Perl regexes have a /s and Java Pattern.DOTALL, for example, to make . match any character at all. For languages that don\\'t have such a feature, you can use something like [\\\\s\\\\S] to match \"any whitespace or any non-whitespace\", in other words anything.']}},\n",

       "      'We start by answering the first question:Why do I get ValueError: Index contains duplicate entries, cannot reshapeThis occurs because pandas is attempting to reindex either a columns or index object with duplicate entries.  There are varying methods to use that can perform a pivot.  Some of them are not well suited to when there are duplicates of the keys in which it is being asked to pivot on.  For example.  Consider pd.DataFrame.pivot.  I know there are duplicate entries that share the row and col values:df.duplicated([\\'row\\', \\'col\\']).any()\\n\\nTrue\\nSo when I pivot usingdf.pivot(index=\\'row\\', columns=\\'col\\', values=\\'val0\\')\\nI get the error mentioned above.  In fact, I get the same error when I try to perform the same task with:df.set_index([\\'row\\', \\'col\\'])[\\'val0\\'].unstack()\\nHere is a list of idioms we can use to pivotpd.DataFrame.groupbypd.DataFrame.unstack\\n\\nunstack\\npd.DataFrame.pivot_table\\ngroupby\\n\\npd.DataFrame.set_indexpd.DataFrame.unstack\\n\\ngroupbyunstack\\npd.DataFrame.pivot\\nset_indexindexcolumnsvalues\\npivot_table\\npd.crosstab\\npivot_table\\npd.factorizenp.bincount\\n\\npd.get_dummiespd.DataFrame.dot\\n\\nWhat I\\'m going to do for each subsequent answer and question is to answer it using pd.DataFrame.pivot_table.

I heard that a lot during my career. Actually, it was one the questions I answered in my current job\\'s technical interview. It is, actually, so common that StackOverflow community has created a single tag just to deal with questions like that: .Basically, you have two approaches to solve that problem:group-identifier, max-value-in-groupIn this approach, you first find the group-identifier, max-value-in-group (already solved above) in a sub-query. Then you join your table to the sub-query with equality on both group-identifier and max-value-in-group:SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents\\nFROM YourTable a\\nINNER JOIN (\\n    SELECT id, MAX(rev) rev\\n    FROM YourTable\\n    GROUP BY id\\n) b ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev = b.rev\\nIn this approach, you left join the table with itself. Equality goes in the group-identifier. Then, 2 smart moves: NULLLEFT JOINNULLSo you end up with:SELECT a.*\\nFROM YourTable a\\nLEFT OUTER JOIN YourTable b\\n    ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev < b.rev\\nWHERE b.id IS NULL;\\nBoth approaches bring the exact same result. If you have two rows with max-value-in-group for group-identifier, both rows will be in the result in both approaches.Both approaches are SQL ANSI compatible, thus, will work with your favorite RDBMS, regardless of its \"flavor\".Both approaches are also performance friendly, however your mileage may vary (RDBMS, DB Structure, Indexes, etc.).

It has some good features\\n\\n\\nIt is a little bit ugly and requires that you know something about the range of valid values of the  column.  Let us assume that we know the  column is a number between 0.00 and 999 including decimals but that there will only ever be two digits to the right of the decimal point (e.g. 34.17 would be a valid value).The gist of the thing is that you create a single synthetic column by string concatenating/packing the primary comparison field along with the data you want.  In this way, you can force SQL\\'s MAX() aggregate function to return all of the data (because it has been packed into a single column).  Then you have to unpack the data.Here\\'s how it looks with the above example, written in SQLSELECT id, \\n       CAST(SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 2 FOR 6) AS float) as max_rev,\\n       SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 11) AS content_for_max_rev \\nFROM  (SELECT id, \\n       CAST(1000 + rev + .001 as CHAR) || \\'---\\' || CAST(content AS char) AS packed_col\\n       FROM yourtable\\n      ) \\nGROUP BY id\\nThe packing begins by forcing the  column to be a number of known character length regardless of the value of  so that for example\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you do it right, string comparison of two numbers should yield the same \"max\" as numeric comparison of the two numbers and it\\'s easy to convert back to the original number using the substring function (which is available in one form or another pretty much everywhere).',\n",

Maybe it's because MySQL is pretty bad at optimizing the other solutions (at least in the 5.0 days when I came up with this solution).One important thing is that GROUP_CONCAT has a maximum length for the string it can build up. You probably want to raise this limit by setting the group_concat_max_len variable. And keep in mind that this will be a limit on scaling if you have a large number of rows.Anyway, the above doesn't directly work if your content field is already text.

Python and C# can do that too, but they use a different syntax from those first two. However, if you are forced to use one of the many less powerful pattern-matching languages, then it’s best to use a real parser.It\\'s also important to understand that validating it per the RFC tells you absolutely nothing about whether that address actually exists at the supplied domain, or whether the person entering the address is its true owner. People sign others up to mailing lists this way all the time. Fixing that requires a fancier kind of validation that involves sending that address a message that includes a confirmation token meant to be entered on the same web page as was the address. Confirmation tokens are the only way to know you got the address of the person entering it. This is why most mailing lists now use that mechanism to confirm sign-ups. After all, anybody can put down president@whitehouse.gov, and that will even parse as legal, but it isn\\'t likely to be the person at the other end.For PHP, you should  use the pattern given in  from which I quote:There is some danger that common usage and widespread sloppy coding will establish a de facto standard for e-mail addresses that is more restrictive than the recorded formal standard.That is no better than all the other non-RFC patterns. It isn’t even smart enough to handle even , let alone RFC 5322. , however, is.If you want to get fancy and pedantic, . A regular expression can only act as a rudimentary filter. The problem with regular expressions is that telling someone that their perfectly valid e-mail address is invalid (a false positive) because your regular expression can\\'t handle it is just rude and impolite from the user\\'s perspective. A state engine for the purpose can both validate and even correct e-mail addresses that would otherwise be considered invalid as it disassembles the e-mail address according to each RFC. This allows for a potentially more pleasing experience, likeThe specified e-mail address \\'myemail@address,com\\' is invalid.

For example, it accepts these strings as valid e-mail addresses:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn some of these cases, only the last part of the strings is parsed as the address; the rest before that is the display name. To get a plain e-mail address without any display name, you can check the normalized address against your original string.bool isValid = false;\\n\\ntry\\n{\\n    MailAddress address = new MailAddress(emailAddress);\\n    isValid = (address.Address == emailAddress);\\n    // or\\n    // isValid = string.IsNullOrEmpty(address.DisplayName);\\n}\\ncatch (FormatException)\\n{\\n    // address is invalid\\n}\\nFurthermore, an address having a dot at the end, like user@company. is accepted by MailAddress as well.If you really want to use a regex, :        ',\n",

If you only want to check if an address is grammatically correct then you could use a regular expression, but note that \"\"@[] is a grammatically correct email address that certainly doesn\\'t refer to an existing mailbox.The syntax of email addresses has been defined in various , most notably  and . RFC 822 should be seen as the \"original\" standard and RFC 5322 as the latest standard. The syntax defined in RFC 822 is the most lenient and subsequent standards have restricted the syntax further and further, where newer systems or services should recognize obsolete syntax, but never produce it.In this answer I’ll take “email address” to mean addr-spec as defined in the RFCs (i.e. jdoe@example.org, but not \"John Doe\"<jdoe@example.org>, nor some-group:jdoe@example.org,mrx@exampel.org;).There\\'s one problem with translating the RFC syntaxes into regexes: the syntaxes are not regular! This is because they allow for optional comments in email addresses that can be infinitely nested, while infinite nesting can\\'t be described by a regular expression. To scan for or validate addresses containing comments you need a parser or more powerful expressions. (Note that languages like Perl have constructs to describe context free grammars in a regex-like way.) In this answer I\\'ll disregard comments and only consider proper regular expressions.The RFCs define syntaxes for email messages, not for email addresses as such. Addresses may appear in various header fields and this is where they are primarily defined. When they appear in header fields addresses may contain (between lexical tokens) whitespace, comments and even linebreaks. Semantically this has no significance however. By removing this whitespace, etc. from an address you get a semantically equivalent . Thus, the canonical representation of first. last (comment) @   [3.5.7.9] is first.last@[3.5.7.9].Different syntaxes should be used for different purposes. If you want to scan for email addresses in a (possibly very old) document it may be a good idea to use the syntax as defined in RFC 822. On the other hand, if you want to validate user input you may want to use the syntax as defined in RFC 5322, probably only accepting canonical representations. You should decide which syntax applies to your specific case.I use POSIX \"extended\" regular expressions in this answer, assuming an ASCII compatible character set.I arrived at the following regular expression.

the @-sign). This is because \"..\", \"a..b\" and \"a.\" are  valid dot-atoms, while they may be used as mailbox names. The RFC, however,  allow for local parts like these, except that they have to be quoted. So instead of a..b@example.net you should write \"a..b\"@example.net, which is semantically equivalent.SMTP (as defined in ) further restricts the set of valid email addresses (or actually: mailbox names). It seems reasonable to impose this stricter grammar, so that the matched email address can actually be used to send an email.RFC 5321 basically leaves alone the \"local\" part (i.e. the part before the @-sign), but is stricter on the domain part (i.e. the part after the @-sign). It allows only host names in place of dot-atoms and address literals in place of domain literals.The grammar presented in RFC 5321 is too lenient when it comes to both host names and IP addresses. I took the liberty of \"correcting\" the rules in question, using  and  as guidelines.

common use case is user input validation, for example on an html form. In that case it\\'s usually reasonable to preclude address-literals and to require at least two labels in the hostname. Taking the improved RFC 5321 regex from the previous section as a basis, the resulting expression would be:([-!#-\\'*+/-9=?A-Z^-~]+(\\\\.[-!#-\\'*+/-9=?A-Z^-~]+)*|\"([]!#-[^-~ \\\\t]|(\\\\\\\\[\\\\t -~]))+\")@[0-9A-Za-z]([0-9A-Za-z-]{0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?(\\\\.[0-9A-Za-z]([0-9A-Za-z-]{0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?)+I do not recommend restricting the local part further, e.g. by precluding quoted strings, since we don\\'t know what kind of mailbox names some hosts allow (like \"a..b\"@example.net or even \"a b\"@example.net).I also do not recommend explicitly validating against a list of literal top-level domains or even imposing length-constraints (remember how \".museum\" invalidated [a-z]{2,4}), but if you must:([-!#-\\'*+/-9=?A-Z^-~]+(\\\\.[-!#-\\'*+/-9=?A-Z^-~]+)*|\"([]!#-[^-~ \\\\t]|(\\\\\\\\[\\\\t -~]))+\")@([0-9A-Za-z]([0-9A-Za-z-]{0,61}[0-9A-Za-z])?\\\\.)*(net|org|com|info|)Make sure to keep your regex up-to-date if you decide to go down the path of explicit top-level domain validation.When only accepting host names in the domain part (after the @-sign), the regexes above accept only labels with at most 63 characters, as they should. However, they don\\'t enforce the fact that the entire host name must be at most 253 characters long (including the dots). Although this constraint is strictly speaking still regular, it\\'s not feasible to make a regex that incorporates this rule.Another consideration, especially when using the regexes for input validation, is feedback to the user. If a user enters an incorrect address, it would be nice to give a little more feedback than a simple \"syntactically incorrect address\". With \"vanilla\" regexes this is not possible.These two considerations could be addressed by parsing the address. The extra length constraint on host names could in some cases also be addressed by using an extra regex that checks it, and matching the address against both expressions.None of the regexes in this answer are optimized for performance. If performance is an issue, you should see if (and how) the regex of your choice can be optimized.',\n",

You can also use the by.x and by.y parameters if the matching variables have different names in the different data frames. merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = \"CustomerId\", all = TRUE) merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = \"CustomerId\", all.x = TRUE) merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = \"CustomerId\", all.y = TRUE) merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = NULL)  I think it\\'s almost always best to explicitly state the identifiers on which you want to merge; it\\'s safer if the input data.frames change unexpectedly and easier to read later on.You can merge on multiple columns by giving by a vector, e.g., by = c(\"CustomerId\", \"OrderId\"). If the column names to merge on are not the same, you can specify, e.g., by.x = \"CustomerId_in_df1\", by.y = \"CustomerId_in_df2\" where CustomerId_in_df1 is the name of the column in the first data frame and CustomerId_in_df2 is the name of the column in the second data frame.

It even offers quite an elaborate SQL interface, and even a function to convert (most) SQL code directly into R.The four joining-related functions in the dplyr package are (to quote):\\ninner_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)\\nleft_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)\\nsemi_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)\\nanti_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)\\nIt\\'s all  in great detail.Selecting columns can be done by select(df,\"column\"). If that\\'s not SQL-ish enough for you, then there\\'s the sql() function, into which you can enter SQL code as-is, and it will do the operation you specified just like you were writing in R all along (for more information, please refer to the ).

       "      \"For the case of a left join with a 0..*:0..1 cardinality or a right join with a 0..1:0..* cardinality it is possible to assign in-place the unilateral columns from the joiner (the 0..1 table) directly onto the joinee (the 0..* table), and thereby avoid the creation of an entirely new table of data. This requires matching the key columns from the joinee into the joiner and indexing+ordering the joiner's rows accordingly for the assignment.If the key is a single column, then we can use a single call to match() to do the matching. This is the case I'll cover in this answer.Here's an example based on the OP, except I've added an extra row to df2 with an id of 7 to test the case of a non-matching key in the joiner. This is effectively df1 left join df2:df1 <- data.frame(CustomerId=1:6,Product=c(rep('Toaster',3L),rep('Radio',3L)));\\ndf2 <- data.frame(CustomerId=c(2L,4L,6L,7L),State=c(rep('Alabama',2L),'Ohio','Texas'));\\ndf1[names(df2)[-1L]] <- df2[match(df1[,1L],df2[,1L]),-1L];\\ndf1;\\n##   CustomerId Product   State\\n## 1          1 Toaster    <NA>\\n## 2          2 Toaster Alabama\\n## 3          3 Toaster    <NA>\\n## 4          4   Radio Alabama\\n## 5          5   Radio    <NA>\\n## 6          6   Radio    Ohio\\nIn the above I hard-coded an assumption that the key column is the first column of both input tables. I would argue that, in general, this is not an unreasonable assumption, since, if you have a data.frame with a key column, it would be strange if it had not been set up as the first column of the data.frame from the outset. And you can always reorder the columns to make it so. An advantageous consequence of this assumption is that the name of the key column does not have to be hard-coded, although I suppose it's just replacing one assumption with another. Concision is another advantage of integer indexing, as well as speed. In the benchmarks below I'll change the implementation to use string name indexing to match the competing implementations.I think this is a particularly appropriate solution if you have several tables that you want to left join against a single large table. Repeatedly rebuilding the entire table for each merge would be unnecessary and inefficient.On the other hand, if you need the joinee to remain unaltered through this operation for whatever reason, then this solution cannot be used, since it modifies the joinee directly. Although in that case you could simply make a copy and perform the in-place assignment(s) on the copy.As a side note, I briefly looked into possible matching solutions for multicolumn keys. Unfortunately, the only matching solutions I found were:\\nmatch(interaction(df1$a,df1$b),interaction(df2$a,df2$b))paste()\\nouter(df1$a,df2$a,`==`) & outer(df1$b,df2$b,`==`)\\nmerge()\\nFor example, see , , , and the dupe of this question where I originally came up with the in-place solution, .I decided to do my own benchmarking to see how the in-place assignment approach compares to the other solutions that have been offered in this question.Testing code:library(microbenchmark);\\nlibrary(data.table);\\nlibrary(sqldf);\\nlibrary(plyr);\\nlibrary(dplyr);\\n\\nsolSpecs <- list(\\n    merge=list(testFuncs=list(\\n        inner=function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key),\\n        left =function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key,all.x=T),\\n        right=function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key,all.y=T),\\n        full =function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key,all=T)\\n    )),\\n    data.table.unkeyed=list(argSpec='data.table.unkeyed',testFuncs=list(\\n        inner=function(dt1,dt2,key) dt1[dt2,on=key,nomatch=0L,allow.cartesian=T],\\n        left =function(dt1,dt2,key) dt2[dt1,on=key,allow.cartesian=T],\\n        right=function(dt1,dt2,key) dt1[dt2,on=key,allow.cartesian=T],\\n        full =function(dt1,dt2,key) merge(dt1,dt2,key,all=T,allow.cartesian=T) ## calls merge.data.table()\\n    )),\\n    data.table.keyed=list(argSpec='data.table.keyed',testFuncs=list(\\n        inner=function(dt1,dt2) dt1[dt2,nomatch=0L,allow.cartesian=T],\\n        left =function(dt1,dt2) dt2[dt1,allow.cartesian=T],\\n        right=function(dt1,dt2) dt1[dt2,allow.cartesian=T],\\n        full =function(dt1,dt2) merge(dt1,dt2,all=T,allow.cartesian=T) ## calls merge.data.table()\\n    )),\\n    sqldf.unindexed=list(testFuncs=list( ## note: must pass connection=NULL to avoid running against the live DB connection, which would result in collisions with the residual tables from the last query upload\\n        inner=function(df1,df2,key) sqldf(paste0('select * from df1 inner join df2 using(',paste(collapse=',',key),')'),connection=NULL),\\n        left =function(df1,df2,key) sqldf(paste0('select * from df1 left join df2 using(',paste(collapse=',',key),')'),connection=NULL),\\n        right=function(df1,df2,key) sqldf(paste0('select * from df2 left join df1 using(',paste(collapse=',',key),')'),connection=NULL) ## can't do right join proper, not yet supported;

So, for simplicity and without actual loss of generality, say you have T sublists of k items each: the first k items are copied back and forth T-1 times, the second k items T-2 times, and so on; total number of copies is k times the sum of x for x from 1 to T excluded, i.e., k * (T**2)/2.The list comprehension just generates one list, once, and copies each item over (from its original place of residence to the result list) also exactly once.\",\n",

The recursion goes down until it finds a non-list element, then extends the local variable flist and then rolls back it to the parent. Whenever flist is returned, it is extended to the parent's flist in the list comprehension. Therefore, at the root, a flat list is returned.The above one creates several local lists and returns them which are used to extend the parent's list. I think the way around for this may be creating a gloabl flist, like below.a = [[1, 2], [[[[3, 4, 5], 6]]], 7, [8, [9, [10, 11], 12, [13, 14, [15, [[16, 17], 18]]]]]]\\nflist = []\\ndef make_list_flat (l):\\n    flist.extend ([l]) if (type (l) is not list) else [make_list_flat (e) for e in l]\\n\\nmake_list_flat(a)\\nprint (flist)\\nThe output is again[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]\\nAlthough I am not sure at this time about the efficiency.\",\n",
