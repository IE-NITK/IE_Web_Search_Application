       "      'All you need is a GROUP BY clause with the MAX aggregate function:SELECT id, MAX(rev)\\nFROM YourTable\\nGROUP BY id\\nI just noticed you need the content column as well.This is a very common question in SQL: find the whole data for the row with some max value in a column per some group identifier. I heard that a lot during my career. Actually, it was one the questions I answered in my current job\\'s technical interview. It is, actually, so common that StackOverflow community has created a single tag just to deal with questions like that: .Basically, you have two approaches to solve that problem:group-identifier, max-value-in-groupIn this approach, you first find the group-identifier, max-value-in-group (already solved above) in a sub-query. Then you join your table to the sub-query with equality on both group-identifier and max-value-in-group:SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents\\nFROM YourTable a\\nINNER JOIN (\\n    SELECT id, MAX(rev) rev\\n    FROM YourTable\\n    GROUP BY id\\n) b ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev = b.rev\\nIn this approach, you left join the table with itself. Equality goes in the group-identifier. Then, 2 smart moves: NULLLEFT JOINNULLSo you end up with:SELECT a.*\\nFROM YourTable a\\nLEFT OUTER JOIN YourTable b\\n    ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev < b.rev\\nWHERE b.id IS NULL;\\nBoth approaches bring the exact same result. If you have two rows with max-value-in-group for group-identifier, both rows will be in the result in both approaches.Both approaches are SQL ANSI compatible, thus, will work with your favorite RDBMS, regardless of its \"flavor\".Both approaches are also performance friendly, however your mileage may vary (RDBMS, DB Structure, Indexes, etc.). So when you pick one approach over the other, . And make sure you pick the one which make most of sense to you.',\n",

       "      'I can\\'t vouch for the performance, but here\\'s a trick inspired by the limitations of Microsoft Excel.  It has some good features\\n\\n\\nIt is a little bit ugly and requires that you know something about the range of valid values of the  column.  Let us assume that we know the  column is a number between 0.00 and 999 including decimals but that there will only ever be two digits to the right of the decimal point (e.g. 34.17 would be a valid value).The gist of the thing is that you create a single synthetic column by string concatenating/packing the primary comparison field along with the data you want.  In this way, you can force SQL\\'s MAX() aggregate function to return all of the data (because it has been packed into a single column).  Then you have to unpack the data.Here\\'s how it looks with the above example, written in SQLSELECT id, \\n       CAST(SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 2 FOR 6) AS float) as max_rev,\\n       SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 11) AS content_for_max_rev \\nFROM  (SELECT id, \\n       CAST(1000 + rev + .001 as CHAR) || \\'---\\' || CAST(content AS char) AS packed_col\\n       FROM yourtable\\n      ) \\nGROUP BY id\\nThe packing begins by forcing the  column to be a number of known character length regardless of the value of  so that for example\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you do it right, string comparison of two numbers should yield the same \"max\" as numeric comparison of the two numbers and it\\'s easy to convert back to the original number using the substring function (which is available in one form or another pretty much everywhere).',\n",

This will be faster.  Or, it will be much faster, if you have indexing, and you compare it to a query that looks at all rows.With ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY disabled, we can use still use GROUP BY, but then we are only using it on the Salary, and not the id:SELECT *\\nFROM\\n    (SELECT *\\n    FROM Employee\\n    ORDER BY Salary DESC)\\nAS employeesub\\nGROUP BY employeesub.Salary;\\n\\nSELECT *\\nFROM Employee\\n(SELECT *...)\\nGROUP BY employeesub.Salary\\nNote the : \"Each row in a table has its own unique key.\"  This would mean that, in the question\\'s example, id would  unique, and in that case, we can just do :SELECT *\\nFROM Employee\\nWHERE Employee.id = 12345\\nORDER BY Employee.Salary DESC\\nLIMIT 1\\nHopefully this is a solution that solves the problem and helps everyone better understand what\\'s happening in the DB.',\n",

Maybe that just for my use cases, but I have used it on tables with millions of records and many unique ids. Maybe it's because MySQL is pretty bad at optimizing the other solutions (at least in the 5.0 days when I came up with this solution).One important thing is that GROUP_CONCAT has a maximum length for the string it can build up. You probably want to raise this limit by setting the group_concat_max_len variable. And keep in mind that this will be a limit on scaling if you have a large number of rows.Anyway, the above doesn't directly work if your content field is already text. In that case you probably want to use a different separator, like \\\\0 maybe. You'll also run into the group_concat_max_len limit quicker.\",\n",

With the traditional approaches the complex join would be done twice.The above combination is simple with bit functions when rev and id are INT UNSIGNED (32 bit) and combined value fits to BIGINT UNSIGNED (64 bit). When the id & rev are larger than 32-bit values or made of multiple columns, you need combine the value into e.g. a binary value with suitable padding for MAX().'],\n",

Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:>>> words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']\\n>>> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.\\n...     if len(w) > 6:\\n...         words.insert(0, w)\\n...\\n>>> words\\n['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']\\nThis part of the docs says once again that you have to make a copy, and gives an actual removal example:Note: There is a subtlety when the sequence is being modified by the loop (this can only occur for mutable sequences, i.e. lists). An internal counter is used to keep track of which item is used next, and this is incremented on each iteration. When this counter has reached the length of the sequence the loop terminates. This means that if the suite deletes the current (or a previous) item from the sequence, the next item will be skipped (since it gets the index of the current item which has already been treated). Likewise, if the suite inserts an item in the sequence before the current item, the current item will be treated again the next time through the loop. This can lead to nasty bugs that can be avoided by making a temporary copy using a slice of the whole sequence, e.g.,for x in a[:]:\\n    if x < 0: a.remove(x)\\nHowever, I disagree with this implementation, since .remove() has to iterate the  to find the value.It seems like this particular Python API could be improved. Compare it, for instance, with:\\n\\nstd::vector::erase\\nboth of which make it crystal clear that you cannot modify a list being iterated except with the iterator itself, and gives you efficient ways to do so without copying the list.Perhaps the underlying rationale is that Python lists are assumed to be dynamic array backed, and therefore any type of removal will be time inefficient anyways, while Java has a nicer interface hierarchy with both ArrayList and LinkedList implementations of ListIterator.There doesn't seem to be an explicit linked list type in the Python stdlib either: \",\n",

       "      'This answer was originally written in response to a question which has since been marked as duplicate:\\nThere are two problems in your code:1) When using remove(), you attempt to remove integers whereas you need to remove a tuple.2) The for loop will skip items in your list.Let\\'s run through what happens when we execute your code:>>> L1 = [(1,2), (5,6), (-1,-2), (1,-2)]\\n>>> for (a,b) in L1:\\n...   if a < 0 or b < 0:\\n...     L1.remove(a,b)\\n... \\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 3, in <module>\\nTypeError: remove() takes exactly one argument (2 given)\\nThe first problem is that you are passing both \\'a\\' and \\'b\\' to remove(), but remove() only accepts a single argument. So how can we get remove() to work properly with your list? We need to figure out what each element of your list is. In this case, each one is a tuple. To see this, let\\'s access one element of the list (indexing starts at 0):>>> L1[1]\\n(5, 6)\\n>>> type(L1[1])\\n<type \\'tuple\\'>\\nAha! Each element of L1 is actually a tuple. So that\\'s what we need to be passing to remove(). Tuples in python are very easy, they\\'re simply made by enclosing values in parentheses. \"a, b\" is not a tuple, but \"(a, b)\" is a tuple. So we modify your code and run it again:# The remove line now includes an extra \"()\" to make a tuple out of \"a,b\"\\nL1.remove((a,b))\\nThis code runs without any error, but let\\'s look at the list it outputs: L1 is now: [(1, 2), (5, 6), (1, -2)]\\nWhy is (1,-2) still in your list? It turns out modifying the list while using a loop to iterate over it is a very bad idea without special care. The reason that (1, -2) remains in the list is that the locations of each item within the list changed between iterations of the for loop. Let\\'s look at what happens if we feed the above code a longer list:L1 = [(1,2),(5,6),(-1,-2),(1,-2),(3,4),(5,7),(-4,4),(2,1),(-3,-3),(5,-1),(0,6)]\\n### Outputs:\\nL1 is now: [(1, 2), (5, 6), (1, -2), (3, 4), (5, 7), (2, 1), (5, -1), (0, 6)]\\nAs you can infer from that result, every time that the conditional statement evaluates to true and a list item is removed, the next iteration of the loop will skip evaluation of the next item in the list because its values are now located at different indices.The most intuitive solution is to copy the list, then iterate over the original list and only modify the copy. You can try doing so like this:L2 = L1\\nfor (a,b) in L1:\\n    if a < 0 or b < 0 :\\n        L2.remove((a,b))\\n# Now, remove the original copy of L1 and replace with L2\\nprint L2 is L1\\ndel L1\\nL1 = L2; del L2\\nprint (\"L1 is now: \", L1)\\nHowever, the output will be identical to before:\\'L1 is now: \\', [(1, 2), (5, 6), (1, -2), (3, 4), (5, 7), (2, 1), (5, -1), (0, 6)]\\nThis is because when we created L2, python did not actually create a new object. Instead, it merely referenced L2 to the same object as L1. We can verify this with \\'is\\' which is different from merely \"equals\" (==).>>> L2=L1\\n>>> L1 is L2\\nTrue\\nWe can make a true copy using copy.copy(). Then everything works as expected:import copy\\nL1 = [(1,2), (5,6),(-1,-2), (1,-2),(3,4),(5,7),(-4,4),(2,1),(-3,-3),(5,-1),(0,6)]\\nL2 = copy.copy(L1)\\nfor (a,b) in L1:\\n    if a < 0 or b < 0 :\\n        L2.remove((a,b))\\n# Now, remove the original copy of L1 and replace with L2\\ndel L1\\nL1 = L2; del L2\\n>>> L1 is now: [(1, 2), (5, 6), (3, 4), (5, 7), (2, 1), (0, 6)]\\nFinally, there is one cleaner solution than having to make an entirely new copy of L1. The reversed() function:L1 = [(1,2), (5,6),(-1,-2), (1,-2),(3,4),(5,7),(-4,4),(2,1),(-3,-3),(5,-1),(0,6)]\\nfor (a,b) in reversed(L1):\\n    if a < 0 or b < 0 :\\n        L1.remove((a,b))\\nprint (\"L1 is now: \", L1)\\n>>> L1 is now: [(1, 2), (5, 6), (3, 4), (5, 7), (2, 1), (0, 6)]\\nUnfortunately, I cannot adequately describe how reversed() works. It returns a \\'listreverseiterator\\' object when a list is passed to it. For practical purposes, you can think of it as creating a reversed copy of its argument. This is the solution I recommend.',\n",

And so if you are sure that you really do want the code pattern described in the original question, it is possible.Should work on all mutable sequences not just lists.Full answer:Edit: The last code example in this answer gives a use case for  you might sometimes want to modify a list in place rather than use a list comprehension. The first part of the answers serves as tutorial of  an array can be modified in place.The solution follows on from  answer (for a related question) from senderle. Which explains how the the array index is updated while iterating through a list that has been modified. The solution below is designed to correctly track the array index even if the list is modified.Download fluidIter.py from  https://github.com/alanbacon/FluidIterator, it is just a single file so no need to install git. There is no installer so you will need to make sure that the file is in the python path your self. The code has been written for python 3 and is untested on python 2.from fluidIter import FluidIterable\\nl = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]  \\nfluidL = FluidIterable(l)                       \\nfor i in fluidL:\\n    print(\\'initial state of list on this iteration: \\' + str(fluidL)) \\n    print(\\'current iteration value: \\' + str(i))\\n    print(\\'popped value: \\' + str(fluidL.pop(2)))\\n    print(\\' \\')\\n\\nprint(\\'Final List Value: \\' + str(l))\\nThis will produce the following output:initial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 0\\npopped value: 2\\n\\ninitial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 1\\npopped value: 3\\n\\ninitial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 4\\npopped value: 4\\n\\ninitial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 5\\npopped value: 5\\n\\ninitial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 6, 7, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 6\\npopped value: 6\\n\\ninitial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 7, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 7\\npopped value: 7\\n\\ninitial state of list on this iteration: [0, 1, 8]\\ncurrent iteration value: 8\\npopped value: 8\\n\\nFinal List Value: [0, 1]\\nAbove we have used the pop method on the fluid list object. Other common iterable methods are also implemented such as del fluidL[i], .remove, .insert, .append, .extend. The list can also be modified using slices (sort and reverse methods are not implemented).The only condition is that you must only modify the list in place, if at any point fluidL or l were reassigned to a different list object the code would not work. The original fluidL object would still be used by the for loop but would become out of scope for us to modify.i.e.fluidL[2] = \\'a\\'   # is OK\\nfluidL = [0, 1, \\'a\\', 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]  # is not OK\\nIf we want to access the current index value of the list we cannot use enumerate, as this only counts how many times the for loop has run. Instead we will use the iterator object directly.fluidArr = FluidIterable([0,1,2,3])\\n# get iterator first so can query the current index\\nfluidArrIter = fluidArr.__iter__()\\nfor i, v in enumerate(fluidArrIter):\\n    print(\\'enum: \\', i)\\n    print(\\'current val: \\', v)\\n    print(\\'current ind: \\', fluidArrIter.currentIndex)\\n    print(fluidArr)\\n    fluidArr.insert(0,\\'a\\')\\n    print(\\' \\')\\n\\nprint(\\'Final List Value: \\' + str(fluidArr))\\nThis will output the following:enum:  0\\ncurrent val:  0\\ncurrent ind:  0\\n[0, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\nenum:  1\\ncurrent val:  1\\ncurrent ind:  2\\n[\\'a\\', 0, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\nenum:  2\\ncurrent val:  2\\ncurrent ind:  4\\n[\\'a\\', \\'a\\', 0, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\nenum:  3\\ncurrent val:  3\\ncurrent ind:  6\\n[\\'a\\', \\'a\\', \\'a\\', 0, 1, 2, 3]\\n\\nFinal List Value: [\\'a\\', \\'a\\', \\'a\\', \\'a\\', 0, 1, 2, 3]\\nThe FluidIterable class just provides a wrapper for the original list object. The original object can be accessed as a property of the fluid object like so:originalList = fluidArr.fixedIterable\\nMore examples / tests can be found in the if __name__ is \"__main__\": section at the bottom of fluidIter.py. These are worth looking at because they explain what happens in various situations. Such as: Replacing a large sections of the list using a slice. Or using (and modifying) the same iterable in nested for loops.As I stated to start with: this is a complicated solution that will hurt the readability of your code and make it more difficult to debug. Therefore other solutions such as the list comprehensions mentioned in David Raznick\\'s  should be considered first. That being said, I have found times where this class has been useful to me and has been easier to use than keeping track of the indices of elements that need deleting.Edit: As mentioned in the comments, this answer does not really present a problem for which this approach provides a solution. I will try to address that here:List comprehensions provide a way to generate a new list but these approaches tend to look at each element in isolation rather than the current state of the list as a whole.i.e.newList = [i for i in oldList if testFunc(i)]\\nBut what if the result of the testFunc depends on the elements that have been added to newList already? Or the elements still in oldList that might be added next? There might still be a way to use a list comprehension but it will begin to lose it\\'s elegance, and for me it feels easier to modify a list in place.The code below is one example of an algorithm that suffers from the above problem. The algorithm will reduce a list so that no element is a multiple of any other element.randInts = [70, 20, 61, 80, 54, 18, 7, 18, 55, 9]\\nfRandInts = FluidIterable(randInts)\\nfRandIntsIter = fRandInts.__iter__()\\n# for each value in the list (outer loop)\\n# test against every other value in the list (inner loop)\\nfor i in fRandIntsIter:\\n    print(\\' \\')\\n    print(\\'outer val: \\', i)\\n    innerIntsIter = fRandInts.__iter__()\\n    for j in innerIntsIter:\\n        innerIndex = innerIntsIter.currentIndex\\n        # skip the element that the outloop is currently on\\n        # because we don\\'t want to test a value against itself\\n        if not innerIndex == fRandIntsIter.currentIndex:\\n            # if the test element, j, is a multiple \\n            # of the reference element, i, then remove \\'j\\'\\n            if j%i == 0:\\n                print(\\'remove val: \\', j)\\n                # remove element in place, without breaking the\\n                # iteration of either loop\\n                del fRandInts[innerIndex]\\n            # end if multiple, then remove\\n        # end if not the same value as outer loop\\n    # end inner loop\\n# end outerloop\\n\\nprint(\\'\\')\\nprint(\\'final list: \\', randInts)\\nThe output and the final reduced list are shown belowouter val:  70\\n\\nouter val:  20\\nremove val:  80\\n\\nouter val:  61\\n\\nouter val:  54\\n\\nouter val:  18\\nremove val:  54\\nremove val:  18\\n\\nouter val:  7\\nremove val:  70\\n\\nouter val:  55\\n\\nouter val:  9\\nremove val:  18\\n\\nfinal list:  [20, 61, 7, 55, 9]\\n',\n",
       "      \"The other answers are correct that it is usually a bad idea to delete from a list that you're iterating. Reverse iterating avoids the pitfalls, but it is much more difficult to follow code that does that, so usually you're better off using a list comprehension or filter.There is, however, one case where it is safe to remove elements from a sequence that you are iterating: if you're only removing one item while you're iterating. This can be ensured using a return or a break. For example:for i, item in enumerate(lst):\\n    if item % 4 == 0:\\n        foo(item)\\n        del lst[i]\\n        break\\nThis is often easier to understand than a list comprehension when you're doing some operations with side effects on the first item in a list that meets some condition and then removing that item from the list immediately after.\",\n",

       "      \"There are a lot of good answers here but I want to add a little more about the reasons  you should normally avoid these (the question just came up again in a duplicate topic):With few exceptions, if you are using these methods you are probably fine-tuning your GUI to look good on a specific look-and-feel (and with your system-specific settings, e.g. your preferred desktop font, etc.). The methods themselves aren't inherently evil, but the typical reasons for using them . As soon as you start tuning pixel positions and sizes in a layout you run the risk of your GUI breaking (or at minimum, looking bad), on other platforms.As an example of this, try changing your application's default look-and-feel. Even just with the options available on your platform, you may be surprised at how poorly the results can be rendered.So, in the name of keeping your GUI functional and nice-looking on all platforms (remember, one of the major benefits of Java is its cross-platformness), you should rely on layout managers, etc., to automatically adjust the sizes of your components so that it renders correctly outside of your specific development environment.All that said, you can certainly conceive of situations where these methods are justified. Again, they aren't inherently evil, but their usage is normally a  red flag indicating potential GUI issues. Just make sure you are aware of the high potential for complications if/when you use them, and always try and think if there is another look-and-feel-independent solution to your problems -- more often than not you will find that these methods are not necessary.By the way, if you find yourself getting frustrated with standard layout managers, there are a lot of good free, open-source third-party ones, for example FormLayout, or MigLayout. Some GUI builders even have built-in support for third-party layout managers -- Eclipse's WindowBuilder GUI editor, for example, ships with support for FormLayout and MigLayout.\",\n",
       "      \"If you are having trouble with layouts in Java Swing, then I can highly recommend the JGoodies FormLayout provided freely as part of the Forms freeware library by Karsten Lentzsch .This very popular layout manager is extremely flexible, allowing for very polished Java UIs to be developed.You'll find Karsten's documentation in , and some rather good documentation from eclipse .\",\n",
       "      \"These methods are poorly understood by most people. You should absolutely not ignore these methods. It is up to the layout manager if they honor these methods. This page has a table that shows which layout managers honor which of those methods:I have been writing Swing code for 8+ years and the layout managers included in the JDK have always served my needs. I have never needed a 3rd party layout manager to achieve my layouts.I will say that you shouldn't try to give the layout manager hints with these methods until you are sure you need them. Do your layout without giving any sizing hints (i.e. let the layout manager do its job) and then you can make minor corrections if you need to.\",\n",
       "      \"In a situation where I need to define proportions between children of a Component (child 1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom layout manager?Maybe GridBagLayout would satisfy your needs. Besides that, there's a ton of layout managers on the web, and I bet there's one that fits your requirements.\",\n",
       "      \"I am seeing it differenty than the accepted answer.Never avoid! They're there to express the size constraints of your components to the layout manager. You can avoid using them if you're not using any layout manager and try to manage the visual layout on your own.Unfortunately, Swing is not coming with reasonable default dimensions. However, instead of setting the dimensions of a component, it is better OOP to descend your own component with reasonable defaults. (In that case you call setXXX in your descendant class.) Alternatively, you can override the getXXX methods for the same effect.Always. When you create a component, set its realistic min/preferred/max size according to the use of that component. For example, if you have a JTextField for entering country symbols such as UK, its preferred size shall be as wide to fit two chars (with the current font, etc.) but probably it is meaningless to let it grow any bigger. After all, country symbols are two chars.\\nAs opposite, if you have a JTextField for entering e.g. a customer name, it can have a preferred size for like the pixel size for 20 chars, but can grow to bigger if the layout is resized, so set the maximum size to more. At the same time, having a 0px wide JTextField is pointless, so set a realistic minimum size (I would say the pixel size of 2 chars).(I can only think adding portability between systems with different screen resolution).No negative consequences. These are hints for the layout manager.Do I really need to implement a new LayoutManager for every little variation on my layout ?No, definitely not. The usual approach is to cascade different basic layoutmanagers such as horizontal and vertical layout.For example, the layout below:<pre>\\n+--------------+--------+\\n| ###JTABLE### | [Add]  | \\n| ...data...   |[Remove]|\\n| ...data...   |        |\\n| ...data...   |        |\\n+--------------+--------+\\n</pre>\\nis having two parts. The left and right parts are a horizontal layout. The right part is a JPanel added to the horizontal layout, and this JPanel is having a vertical layout which lays out the buttons vertically.Of course, this can grow tricky with a real life layout. Therefore grid-based layout managers such as MigLayout are much better if you're about to develop anything serious.No, you definitely shall not develop layout managers, unless you need something very special.between children of a Component (eg, child1 should use 10% of space, child2 40% ,child3 50%), is it possible to achieve that without implementing a custom LayoutManager?Basically, once the preferred sizes are set right, you may not want to do anything in percentage. Simply, because percentages are pointless (e.g. it is pointless to have a JTextField 10% of the window size - since one can shrink the window so that JTextField becomes 0px wide, or can expand the window so that the JTextField is across two displays on a multi-display setup).But, may times you may use the percentages to control sizes of bigger building blocks of your gui (panels, for example).You can use JSplitPane where you can pre-set the ratio of the two sides. Or, you can use MigLayout which allows you to set such constraints in percentage, pixels, and other units.\",\n",
       "      '\\nI wouldn\\'t say \"avoid\" them. I\\'d say that if you think you need them, you\\'re probably doing something wrong. Component sizes are determined in context. For example, Text component sizes are determined by the number of rows and columns you specify, combined with the font you may have chosen. Your button and label size will be the size of the graphic, if you set one, or the space needed to display the text you set. Each component has a natural size, and the layout managers will use those to lay everything out without you needing to specify sizes. The main exception is the JScrollPane, which has a size independent of whatever it contains. For those, I will sometimes call setSize(), and let that size determine the initial window size, by calling JFrame.pack(). Usually, I will let the window size determine the JScrollPane size. The user will determine the size of the window. Many layout managers ignore the sizes you set anyway, so they often don\\'t do much good.\\nI believe they were added to provide hints to the layout managers. They may have been written for historical reasons, because layout managers were new, and people didn\\'t fully trust them. I know a few developers who avoided layout managers and placed everything manually, just because they didn\\'t want to bother with learning a new paradigm. It\\'s a terrible idea.\\nThey\\'re ineffective, and they produce bad layouts, with objects getting squeezed or stretched to non-natural sizes. And the layouts will be brittle. Changes to the window size will sometimes break the layout and put things in the wrong places. You shouldn\\'t \"implement\" a new LayoutManager. You should instantiate existing ones. I often use several layout managers in a single window. Each JPanel will have its own layout manager. Some people balk at nested layouts, because they\\'re hard to maintain. When I use them, I give each one its own creation method to make it easier to see what each one does. But I never \"implement\" a layout manager. I just instantiate them. \\nIf you\\'re implementing new layout manager classes for slight variations in layout, you\\'re using them wrong. If you\\'re just implementing new layout managers, you\\'re probably doing something wrong. The only time I\\'ve extended a LayoutManager class, it was to add a zoom slider to a JScrollPane.\\nThe JSplitPane has a way of specifying the percentage each component should get. The divider is movable by default, but you can turn that off if you want. I don\\'t use that feature much. I usually have some components that take up a set size, and the rest of the space is taken up by a scroll pane. The scroll pane size will adjust with the window size. If you have two scroll panes side by side, you can put them in a JSplitPane and specify the percentage of new space given to each one as the user expands and contracts the windows.'],\n",

       "      ' is one of those aspects of the C and C++ language that can be surprising to programmers coming from other languages (other languages try to hide it better). Basically,  it is possible to write C++ programs that do not behave in a predictable way, even though many C++ compilers will not report any errors in the program!Let\\'s look at a classic example:#include <iostream>\\n\\nint main()\\n{\\n    char* p = \"hello!\\\\n\";   // yes I know, deprecated conversion\\n    p[0] = \\'y\\';\\n    p[5] = \\'w\\';\\n    std::cout << p;\\n}\\nThe variable p points to the string literal \"hello!\\\\n\", and the two assignments below try to modify that string literal. What does this program do? According to section 2.14.5 paragraph 11 of the C++ standard, it invokes :The effect of attempting to modify a string literal is undefined.I can hear people screaming \"But wait, I can compile this no problem and get the output yellow\" or \"What do you mean undefined, string literals are stored in read-only memory, so the first assignment attempt results in a core dump\". This is exactly the problem with undefined behavior. Basically, the standard allows anything to happen once you invoke undefined behavior (even nasal demons). If there is a \"correct\" behavior according to your mental model of the language, that model is simply wrong; The C++ standard has the only vote, period.Other examples of undefined behavior include accessing an array beyond its bounds, ,  or writing  like i++ + ++i.Section 1.9 of the C++ standard also mentions undefined behavior\\'s two less dangerous brothers,  and :The semantic descriptions in this International Standard define a parameterized nondeterministic abstract machine.Certain aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this International Standard as  (for example, sizeof(int)). These constitute the parameters of the abstract machine. Each implementation shall include documentation describing its characteristics and behavior in these respects.Certain other aspects and operations of the abstract machine are described in this International Standard as  (for example, order of evaluation of arguments to a function). Where possible, this International Standard defines a set of allowable behaviors. These define the nondeterministic aspects of the abstract machine.Certain other operations are described in this International Standard as  (for example, the  effect of dereferencing the null pointer). [ :  — ]Specifically, section 1.3.24 states:Permissible undefined behavior ranges from , to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message).What can you do to avoid running into undefined behavior? Basically, you have to read  by authors who know what they\\'re talking about. Screw internet tutorials. Screw bullschildt.',\n",

       "      'Maybe easy wording could be easier for understanding than the rigorous definition of the standards.\\nThe language says that we have data-types. The compiler vendors specify what sizes shall they use, and provide a documentation of what they did.\\nYou are doing something wrong. For example, you have a very large value in an int that doesn\\'t fit in char. How do you put that value in char? actually there is no way! Anything could happen, but the most sensible thing would be to take the first byte of that int and put it in char. It is just wrong to do that to assign the first byte, but thats what happens under the hood.\\nWhich function of these two is executed first?void fun(int n, int m);\\n\\nint fun1()\\n{\\n  cout << \"fun1\";\\n  return 1;\\n}\\nint fun2()\\n{\\n  cout << \"fun2\";\\n  return 2;\\n}\\n...\\nfun(fun1(), fun2()); // which one is executed first?\\nThe language doesn\\'t specify the evaluation, left to right or right to left! So an unspecified behavior may or mayn\\'t result in an undefined behavior, but certainly your program should not produce an unspecified behavior.@eSKay I think your question is worth editing the answer to clarify more :)for fun(fun1(), fun2()); isn\\'t the\\n  behaviour \"implementation defined\"?\\n  The compiler has to choose one or the\\n  other course, after all?The difference between implementation-defined and unspecified, is that the compiler is supposed to pick a behavior in the first case but it doesn\\'t have to in the second case. For example, an implementation must have one and only one definition of sizeof(int). So, it can\\'t say that sizeof(int) is 4 for some portion of the program and 8 for others. Unlike unspecified behavior, where the compiler can say OK I am gonna evaluate these arguments left-to-right and the next function\\'s arguments are evaluated right-to-left. It can happen in the same program, that\\'s why it is called . In fact, C++ could have been made easier if some of the unspecified behaviors were specified. Take a look here at :It is claimed that the difference\\n  between what can be produced giving\\n  the compiler this freedom and\\n  requiring \"ordinary left-to-right\\n  evaluation\" can be significant. I\\'m\\n  unconvinced, but with innumerable\\n  compilers \"out there\" taking advantage\\n  of the freedom and some people\\n  passionately defending that freedom, a\\n  change would be difficult and could\\n  take decades to penetrate to the\\n  distant corners of the C and C++\\n  worlds. I am disappointed that not all\\n  compilers warn against code such as\\n  ++i+i++. Similarly, the order of evaluation of arguments is\\n  unspecified.IMO far too many \"things\" are left\\n  undefined, unspecified,\\n  implementation-defined, etc. However,\\n  that\\'s easy to say and even to give\\n  examples of, but hard to fix. It\\n  should also be noted that it is not\\n  all that difficult to avoid most of\\n  the problems and produce portable\\n  code.',\n",
       "      'From the official C Rationale DocumentThe terms  behavior,  behavior, and  behavior are used to categorize the result of writing programs whose properties the Standard does not, or cannot, completely describe.  The goal of adopting this categorization is to allow a certain variety among implementations which permits quality of implementation to be an active force in the marketplace as well as to allow certain popular extensions, without removing the cachet of conformance to the Standard.  Appendix F to the Standard catalogs those behaviors which fall into one of these three categories.  gives the implementor some latitude in translating programs.  This latitude does not extend as far as failing to translate the program.  gives the implementor license not to catch certain program errors that are difficult to diagnose.  It also identifies areas of possible conforming language extension: the implementor may augment the language by providing a definition of the officially undefined behavior.  behavior gives an implementor the freedom to choose the appropriate approach, but requires that this choice be explained to the user.  Behaviors designated as implementation-defined are generally those in which a user could make meaningful coding decisions based on the implementation definition.  Implementors should bear in mind this criterion when deciding how extensive an implementation definition ought to be.  As with unspecified behavior, simply failing to translate the source containing the implementation-defined behavior is not an adequate response. ',\n",

       "      \"Historically, both Implementation-Defined Behavior and Undefined Behavior represented situations in which the authors of the Standard expected that people writing quality implementations would use judgment to decide what behavioral guarantees, if any, would be useful for programs in the intended application field running on the intended targets.  The needs of high-end number-crunching code are quite different from those of low-level systems code, and both UB and IDB give compiler writers flexibility to meet those different needs.  Neither category mandates that implementations behave in a way that's useful for any particular purpose, or even for any purpose whatsoever.  Quality implementations that claim to be suitable for a particular purpose, however, should behave in a manner befitting such purpose .The only difference between Implementation-Defined Behavior and Undefined Behavior is that the former requires that implementations define and document a consistent behavior .  The dividing line between them is not whether it would generally be useful for implementations to define behaviors (compiler writers should define useful behaviors when practical whether the Standard requires them to or not) but .  A judgment that such implementations might exist does not in any way, shape, or form, imply any judgment about the usefulness of supporting a defined behavior on other platforms.Unfortunately, since the mid 1990s compiler writers have started to interpret the lack of behavioral mandates as an judgment that behavioral guarantees aren't worth the cost even in application fields where they're vital, and even on systems where they cost practically nothing.  Instead of treating UB as an invitation to exercise reasonable judgment, compiler writers have started treating it as an excuse  to do so.For example, given the following code:int scaled_velocity(int v, unsigned char pow)\\n{\\n  if (v > 250)\\n    v = 250;\\n  if (v < -250)\\n    v = -250;\\n  return v << pow;\\n}\\na two's-complement implementation would not have to expend any effort\\nwhatsoever to treat the expression v << pow as a two's-complement shift\\nwithout regard for whether v was positive or negative.The preferred philosophy among some of today's compiler writers, however, would suggest that because v can only be negative if the program is going to engage in Undefined Behavior, there's no reason to have the program clip the negative range of v.  Even though left-shifting of negative values used to be supported on every single compiler of significance, and a large amount of existing code relies upon that behavior, modern philosophy would interpret the fact that the Standard says that left-shifting negative values is UB as implying that compiler writers should feel free to ignore that.\",\n",

       "      'New coders sometimes write code like this:my_calculator.button_0 = tkinter.Button(root, text=0)\\nmy_calculator.button_1 = tkinter.Button(root, text=1)\\nmy_calculator.button_2 = tkinter.Button(root, text=2)\\n...\\nThe coder is then left with a pile of named variables, with a coding effort of O( * ), where  is the number of named variables and  is the number of times that group of variables needs to be accessed (including creation). The more astute beginner observes that the only difference in each of those lines is a number that changes based on a rule, and decides to use a loop. However, they get stuck on how to dynamically create those variable names, and may try something like this:for i in range(10):\\n    my_calculator.(\\'button_%d\\' % i) = tkinter.Button(root, text=i)\\nThey soon find that this does not work.If the program requires arbitrary variable \"names,\" a dictionary is the best choice, as explained in other answers. However, if you\\'re simply trying to create many variables and you don\\'t mind referring to them with a sequence of integers, you\\'re probably looking for a list. This is particularly true if your data are homogeneous, such as daily temperature readings, weekly quiz scores, or a grid of graphical widgets.This can be assembled as follows:my_calculator.buttons = []\\nfor i in range(10):\\n    my_calculator.buttons.append(tkinter.Button(root, text=i))\\nThis list can also be created in one line with a comprehension:my_calculator.buttons = [tkinter.Button(root, text=i) for i in range(10)]\\nThe result in either case is a populated list, with the first element accessed with my_calculator.buttons[0], the next with my_calculator.buttons[1], and so on. The \"base\" variable name becomes the name of the list and the varying identifier is used to access it.Finally, don\\'t forget other data structures, such as the set - this is similar to a dictionary, except that each \"name\" doesn\\'t have a value attached to it. If you simply need a \"bag\" of objects, this can be a great choice. Instead of something like this:keyword_1 = \\'apple\\'\\nkeyword_2 = \\'banana\\'\\n\\nif query == keyword_1 or query == keyword_2:\\n    print(\\'Match.\\')\\nYou will have this:keywords = {\\'apple\\', \\'banana\\'}\\nif query in keywords:\\n    print(\\'Match.\\')\\nUse a list for a sequence of similar objects, a set for an arbitrarily-ordered bag of objects, or a dict for a bag of names with associated values.',\n",

Most frameworks, including languages like PHP, have default security settings by now that don\\'t allow multiple statements in one SQL string. In PHP, for example, you can only run multiple statements in one SQL string by using the mysqli_multi_query function.You can, however, manipulate an existing SQL statement via SQL injection without having to add a second statement. Let\\'s say you have a login system which checks a username and a password with this simple select:$query=\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\\'\" . $_REQUEST[\\'user\\'] . \"\\' and (password=\\'\".$_REQUEST[\\'pass\\'].\"\\')\";\\n$result=mysql_query($query);\\nIf you provide peter as the username and secret as the password, the resulting SQL string would look like this:SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\\'peter\\' and (password=\\'secret\\')\\nEverything\\'s fine. Now imagine you provide this string as the password:\\' OR \\'1\\'=\\'1\\nThen the resulting SQL string would be this:SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=\\'peter\\' and (password=\\'\\' OR \\'1\\'=\\'1\\')\\nThat would enable you to log in to any account without knowing the password.

       "      \"()To make it clear what's happening, let's try this with a simple table containing only the name field and add a single row:Let's assume the application uses the following SQL to insert data into the table:Replace foobar with the actual name of the student. A normal insert operation would look like this:When we query the table, we get this:What happens when we insert Little Bobby Tables's name into the table?The SQL injection here is the result of the name of the student terminating the statement and including a separate DROP TABLE command; the two dashes at the end of the input are intended to comment out any leftover code that would otherwise cause an error. The last line of the output confirms that the database server has dropped the table.It's important to notice that during the INSERT operation the application isn't checking the input for any special characters, and is therefore allowing arbitrary input to be entered into the SQL command. This means that a malicious user can insert, into a field normally intended for user input, special symbols such as quotes along with arbitrary SQL code to cause the database system to execute it, hence .The result?SQL injection is the database equivalent of a remote  vulnerability in an operating system or application.  The potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack cannot be underestimated--depending on the database system and application configuration, it can be used by an attacker to cause data loss (as in this case), gain unauthorized access to data, or even execute arbitrary code on the host machine itself.As noted by the XKCD comic, one way of protecting against SQL injection attacks is to sanitize database inputs, such as by escaping special characters, so that they cannot modify the underlying SQL command and therefore cannot cause execution of arbitrary SQL code.  If you use parameterized queries, such as by using SqlParameter in ADO.NET, the input will, at minimum, be automatically sanitized to guard against SQL injection.However, sanitizing inputs at the application level may not stop more advanced SQL injection techniques. For example, mysql_real_escape_string. For added protection, many database systems support . If properly implemented in the backend, prepared statements can make SQL injection impossible by treating data inputs as semantically separate from the rest of the command.\",\n",

Combined with the ; character to end the statement, an attacker can now add whatever sql they want.

Your query would look something like this...\"SELECT * FROM page WHERE id = 4;TRUNCATE page\"\\n<?php\\n...\\n$id = $_GET[\\'id\\'];\\n\\n$pdo = new PDO($database_dsn, $database_user, $database_pass);\\n$query = \"SELECT * FROM page WHERE id = {$id}\";\\n$stmt = $pdo->query($query);\\n$data = $stmt->fetch(); \\n/************* You have lost your data!!! :( *************/\\n...\\n<?php\\n...\\n$id = $_GET[\\'id\\'];\\n\\n$query = \\'SELECT * FROM page WHERE id = :idVal\\';\\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare($query);\\n$stmt->bindParam(\\'idVal\\', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);\\n$stmt->execute();\\n$data = $stmt->fetch();\\n/************* Your data is safe! :) *************/\\n...\\n'],\n",

       "      'One can use  to create  model classes representing structure of  files and use them to access various elements in the  tree. Unlike other solutions this one  and is thus suitable for environments where reflection is impossible or comes with significant overhead.There is a  showing the usage. First of all it defines the structure:@Model(className=\"RepositoryInfo\", properties = {\\n    @Property(name = \"id\", type = int.class),\\n    @Property(name = \"name\", type = String.class),\\n    @Property(name = \"owner\", type = Owner.class),\\n    @Property(name = \"private\", type = boolean.class),\\n})\\nfinal class RepositoryCntrl {\\n    @Model(className = \"Owner\", properties = {\\n        @Property(name = \"login\", type = String.class)\\n    })\\n    static final class OwnerCntrl {\\n    }\\n}\\nand then it uses the generated RepositoryInfo and Owner classes to parse the provided input stream and pick certain information up while doing that:List<RepositoryInfo> repositories = new ArrayList<>();\\ntry (InputStream is = initializeStream(args)) {\\n    Models.parse(CONTEXT, RepositoryInfo.class, is, repositories);\\n}\\n\\nSystem.err.println(\"there is \" + repositories.size() + \" repositories\");\\nrepositories.stream().filter((repo) -> repo != null).forEach((repo) -> {\\n    System.err.println(\"repository \" + repo.getName() + \\n        \" is owned by \" + repo.getOwner().getLogin()\\n    );\\n})\\nThat is it!

       "      'The use of  (those <% %> things) in  is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of  (like ) and  (, those ${} things) way back in 2001.The major disadvantages of  are: Oracle itself also recommends in the  to avoid use of  whenever the same functionality is possible by (tag) classes. Here are several cites of relevance:From JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help  in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain. ...Where possible,  whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but de-emphasizes the use of scriptlets)....In the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic,  for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called \"value objects\") returned from processing the client\\'s requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.\\nIf you want to invoke the  Java code on  request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if a user is logged in, then implement a  and write code accordingly in doFilter() method. E.g.:public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {\\n    if (((HttpServletRequest) request).getSession().getAttribute(\"user\") == null) {\\n        ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(\"login\"); // Not logged in, redirect to login page.\\n    } else {\\n        chain.doFilter(request, response); // Logged in, just continue request.\\n    }\\n}\\nWhen mapped on an appropriate <url-pattern> covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don\\'t need to copypaste the same piece of code overall JSP pages.\\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to  a request, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a  and write code accordingly in doGet() method. E.g.:protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\\n    try {\\n        List<Product> products = productService.list(); // Obtain all products.\\n        request.setAttribute(\"products\", products); // Store products in request scope.\\n        request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/WEB-INF/products.jsp\").forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to display them in a HTML table.\\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\\n        throw new ServletException(\"Retrieving products failed!\", e);\\n    }\\n}\\nThis way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an <error-page> in web.xml.\\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to  a request, e.g. processing a form submit, then implement a  and write code accordingly in doPost() method. E.g.:protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\\n    String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\\n    String password = request.getParameter(\"password\");\\n    User user = userService.find(username, password);\\n\\n    if (user != null) {\\n        request.getSession().setAttribute(\"user\", user); // Login user.\\n        response.sendRedirect(\"home\"); // Redirect to home page.\\n    } else {\\n        request.setAttribute(\"message\", \"Unknown username/password. Please retry.\"); // Store error message in request scope.\\n        request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/WEB-INF/login.jsp\").forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to redisplay login form with error.\\n    }\\n}\\nThis way dealing with different result page destinations is easier: redisplaying the form with validation errors in case of an error (in this particular example you can redisplay it using ${message} in ), or just taking to the desired target page in case of success.\\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to  the execution plan and/or the destination of the request and the response, then implement a  according to the . E.g.:protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\\n    try {\\n        Action action = ActionFactory.getAction(request);\\n        String view = action.execute(request, response);\\n\\n        if (view.equals(request.getPathInfo().substring(1)) {\\n            request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/WEB-INF/\" + view + \".jsp\").forward(request, response);\\n        } else {\\n            response.sendRedirect(view);\\n        }\\n    } catch (Exception e) {\\n        throw new ServletException(\"Executing action failed.\", e);\\n    }\\n}\\nOr just adopt an MVC framework like , , , etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a JavaBean class without the need for a custom servlet.\\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to  inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like . E.g. displaying List<Product> in a table:<%@ taglib uri=\"http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core\" prefix=\"c\" %>\\n...\\n<table>\\n    <c:forEach items=\"${products}\" var=\"product\">\\n        <tr>\\n            <td>${product.name}</td>\\n            <td>${product.description}</td>\\n            <td>${product.price}</td>\\n        </tr>\\n    </c:forEach>\\n</table>\\nWith XML-style tags which fit nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever  are still been used by adding the following piece to web.xml:<jsp-config>\\n    <jsp-property-group>\\n        <url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>\\n        <scripting-invalid>true</scripting-invalid>\\n    </jsp-property-group>\\n</jsp-config>\\nIn , the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework , it is already  possible to use . This way you\\'re automatically forced to do things \"the right way\".\\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to  \"backend\" data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those ${} things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:<input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"${param.foo}\" />\\nThe ${param.foo} displays the outcome of request.getParameter(\"foo\").\\nIf you want to invoke some  Java code directly in the JSP page (typically public static methods), then you need to define them as EL functions. There\\'s a standard  in JSTL, but . Here\\'s an example how JSTL fn:escapeXml is useful to prevent  .<%@ taglib uri=\"http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions\" prefix=\"fn\" %>\\n...\\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"${fn:escapeXml(param.foo)}\" />\\nNote that the XSS sensitivity is in no way specifically related to Java/JSP/JSTL/EL/whatever, this problem needs to be taken into account in  web application you develop. The problem of  is that it provides no way of builtin preventions, at least not using the standard Java API. JSP\\'s successor Facelets has already implicit HTML escaping, so you don\\'t need to worry about XSS holes in Facelets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "      'As  is discussing, you can and always should disable scriptlets in your web.xml web application descriptor.I would always do that in order to prevent any developer adding scriptlets, especially in bigger companies where you will lose overview sooner or later.

Use a modern approach, like template engines. You will have very clear separation of business and presentation layers, and certainly no Java code in templates, so you can generate templates directly from web presentation editing software, in most cases leveraging WYSIWYG.And certainly stay away of filters and pre and post processing, otherwise you may deal with support/debugging difficulties since you always do not know where the variable gets the value.',\n",

Therefore, setting up the project at the first sign is very important if you really want to reduce the scriptlet code. There are several techniques to get over this (including several frameworks that other mentioned). However, if you prefer the pure JSP way, then use the JSTL tag file.

You can even create a directory structure to package your tags.For example:/WEB-INF/tags/html/label.tag\\n\\n<%@tag description=\"Rensders a label with required css class\" pageEncoding=\"UTF-8\"%>\\n<%@attribute name=\"name\" required=\"true\" description=\"The label\"%>\\n\\n<label class=\"control-label control-default\"  id=\"${name}Label\">${name}</label>\\nUse it like<%@ taglib prefix=\"h\" tagdir=\"/WEB-INF/tags/html\"%>\\n<h:label  name=\"customer name\" />\\nAlso, you can read the tag body easily:/WEB-INF/tags/html/bold.tag\\n<%@tag description=\"Bold tag\" pageEncoding=\"UTF-8\"%>\\n<b>\\n  <jsp:doBody/>\\n</b>\\nUse it:<%@ taglib prefix=\"h\" tagdir=\"/WEB-INF/tags/bold\"%>\\n<h:bold>Make me bold</h:bold>\\nThe samples are very simple, but you can do lots of complicated tasks here. Please consider you can use other tags (for example: JSTL which has controlling tags like if/forEcah/chosen text manipulation like format/contains/uppercase or even SQL tags select/update), pass all kind parameters, for example Hashmap, access session, request, ... in your tag file too. are so easy developed as you did not need to restart the server when changing them, like JSP files. This makes them easy for development.Even if you use a framework like Struts 2, which have lots of good tags, you may find that having your own tags can reduce your code a lot. You can pass your tag parameters to struts and this way customize your framework tag.You can use tags not only to avoid Java, but also minimize your HTML codes. I myself try to review HTML code and build tags a lot as soon as I see code duplicates start in my pages.(Even if you end up using Java in your JSP code, which I hope not, you can encapsulate that code in a tag.)',\n",

       "      'A lot of the answers here go the \"use a framework\" route. There\\'s zero wrong with that. However I don\\'t think it really answers your question, because frameworks may or may not use JSPs, nor are they designed in any way with removing java use in JSPs as a primary goal. \\nThe only good answer to your question \"how do I avoid using Java in a JSP\" is: you can\\'t.  That\\'s what JSPs are for - using Java to render HTML with dynamic data/logic.\\nThe follow up question might be, how much java should I use in my JSPs. Before we answer that question, you should also ponder, \"do I need to use JSPs to build web content using Java?\" The answer to that last one is, no. There are many alternatives to JSPs for developing web facing applications using Java. Struts for example does not force you to use JSPs - don\\'t get me wrong, you can use them and many implementations do, but you don\\'t absolutely have to. Struts doesn\\'t even force you to use any HTML. A JSP doesn\\'t either, but let\\'s be honest, a JSP producing no HTML is kinda weird. Servlets, famously, allow you to serve any kind of content you like over HTTP dynamically. They are  primary tech behind pretty much everything java web - JSPs are just HTML templates for servlets, really. \\nSo the answer to how much java you should put in a JSP is, \"as little as possible\". I of course have java in my JSPs, but it consists exclusively of tag library definitions, session and client variables, and beans encapsulating server side objects. The <%%> tags in my HTML are almost exclusively property calls or variable expressions. Rare exceptions include ultra-specific calculations pertaining to a single page and unlikely to ever be reused; bugfixes stemming from page-specific issues only applying to one page; last minute concatenations and arithmetic stemming from unusual requirements limited in scope to a single page; and other similar cases. In a code set of 1.5 million lines, 3000 JSPs and 5000 classes, there are maybe 100 instances of such unique snippets. It would have been quite possible to make these changes in classes or tag library definitions, but it would have been inordinately complex due to the specificity of each case, taken longer to write and debug, and taken more time as a result to get to my users. It\\'s a judgement call. But make no mistake, you cannot write JSPs of any meaning with \"no java\" nor would you want to. The capability is there for a reason.'],\n",

I heard that a lot during my career. Actually, it was one the questions I answered in my current job\\'s technical interview. It is, actually, so common that StackOverflow community has created a single tag just to deal with questions like that: .Basically, you have two approaches to solve that problem:group-identifier, max-value-in-groupIn this approach, you first find the group-identifier, max-value-in-group (already solved above) in a sub-query. Then you join your table to the sub-query with equality on both group-identifier and max-value-in-group:SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents\\nFROM YourTable a\\nINNER JOIN (\\n    SELECT id, MAX(rev) rev\\n    FROM YourTable\\n    GROUP BY id\\n) b ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev = b.rev\\nIn this approach, you left join the table with itself. Equality goes in the group-identifier. Then, 2 smart moves: NULLLEFT JOINNULLSo you end up with:SELECT a.*\\nFROM YourTable a\\nLEFT OUTER JOIN YourTable b\\n    ON a.id = b.id AND a.rev < b.rev\\nWHERE b.id IS NULL;\\nBoth approaches bring the exact same result. If you have two rows with max-value-in-group for group-identifier, both rows will be in the result in both approaches.Both approaches are SQL ANSI compatible, thus, will work with your favorite RDBMS, regardless of its \"flavor\".Both approaches are also performance friendly, however your mileage may vary (RDBMS, DB Structure, Indexes, etc.). So when you pick one approach over the other, . And make sure you pick the one which make most of sense to you.', 'My preference is to use as little code as possible...You can do it using IN\\ntry this:SELECT * \\nFROM t1 WHERE (id,rev) IN \\n( SELECT id, MAX(rev)\\n  FROM t1\\n  GROUP BY id\\n)\\nto my mind it is less complicated... easier to read and maintain.', 'I am flabbergasted that no answer offered SQL window function solution:SELECT a.id, a.rev, a.contents\\n  FROM (SELECT id, rev, contents,\\n               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY rev DESC) rank\\n          FROM YourTable) a\\n WHERE a.rank = 1 \\nAdded in SQL standard ANSI/ISO Standard SQL:2003  and later extended with ANSI/ISO Standard SQL:2008, window (or windowing) functions are available with all major vendors now.

However I couldnt differentiate between leftjoin and correlated solutions in speed.One final note, as leftjoin creates n*(n+1)/2 joins in groups, its performance can be heavily affected by the size of groups...\", 'I can\\'t vouch for the performance, but here\\'s a trick inspired by the limitations of Microsoft Excel.  It has some good features\\n\\n\\nIt is a little bit ugly and requires that you know something about the range of valid values of the  column.  Let us assume that we know the  column is a number between 0.00 and 999 including decimals but that there will only ever be two digits to the right of the decimal point (e.g. 34.17 would be a valid value).The gist of the thing is that you create a single synthetic column by string concatenating/packing the primary comparison field along with the data you want.  In this way, you can force SQL\\'s MAX() aggregate function to return all of the data (because it has been packed into a single column).  Then you have to unpack the data.Here\\'s how it looks with the above example, written in SQLSELECT id, \\n       CAST(SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 2 FOR 6) AS float) as max_rev,\\n       SUBSTRING(max(packed_col) FROM 11) AS content_for_max_rev \\nFROM  (SELECT id, \\n       CAST(1000 + rev + .001 as CHAR) || \\'---\\' || CAST(content AS char) AS packed_col\\n       FROM yourtable\\n      ) \\nGROUP BY id\\nThe packing begins by forcing the  column to be a number of known character length regardless of the value of  so that for example\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you do it right, string comparison of two numbers should yield the same \"max\" as numeric comparison of the two numbers and it\\'s easy to convert back to the original number using the substring function (which is available in one form or another pretty much everywhere).', 'Newer versions of MySQL come with ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY enabled by default, and many of the solutions here will  in testing with this condition.Even so, we can simply select DISTINCT , MAX(  ), ( *somethirdfield ), etc., and have no worries understanding the result or how the query works :SELECT DISTINCT t1.id, MAX(t1.rev), MAX(t2.content)\\nFROM Table1 AS t1\\nJOIN Table1 AS t2 ON t2.id = t1.id AND t2.rev = (\\n    SELECT MAX(rev) FROM Table1 t3 WHERE t3.id = t1.id\\n)\\nGROUP BY t1.id;\\n\\nSELECT DISTINCT Table1.id, max(Table1.rev), max(Table2.content)DISTINCTMAX()MAX()\\nFROM Employee\\nJOIN Table1 AS Table2 ON Table2.rev = Table1.rev\\nGROUP BY Table1.id\\nNote that since \"content\" was \"...\" in OP\\'s question, there\\'s no way to test that this works.  So, I changed that to \"..a\", \"..b\", so, we can actually now see that the results are correct:id  max(Table1.rev) max(Table2.content)\\n1   3   ..d\\n2   1   ..b\\n  DISTINCT(), MAX(), etc., all make wonderful use of MySQL indices.  This will be faster.  Or, it will be much faster, if you have indexing, and you compare it to a query that looks at all rows.With ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY disabled, we can use still use GROUP BY, but then we are only using it on the Salary, and not the id:SELECT *\\nFROM\\n    (SELECT *\\n    FROM Employee\\n    ORDER BY Salary DESC)\\nAS employeesub\\nGROUP BY employeesub.Salary;\\n\\nSELECT *\\nFROM Employee\\n(SELECT *...)\\nGROUP BY employeesub.Salary\\nNote the : \"Each row in a table has its own unique key.\"  This would mean that, in the question\\'s example, id would  unique, and in that case, we can just do :SELECT *\\nFROM Employee\\nWHERE Employee.id = 12345\\nORDER BY Employee.Salary DESC\\nLIMIT 1\\nHopefully this is a solution that solves the problem and helps everyone better understand what\\'s happening in the DB.', 'Something like this?SELECT yourtable.id, rev, content\\nFROM yourtable\\nINNER JOIN (\\n    SELECT id, max(rev) as maxrev\\n    FROM yourtable\\n    GROUP BY id\\n) AS child ON (yourtable.id = child.id) AND (yourtable.rev = maxrev)\\n', 'Another manner to do the job is using MAX() analytic function in OVER PARTITION clauseSELECT t.*\\n  FROM\\n    (\\n    SELECT id\\n          ,rev\\n          ,contents\\n          ,MAX(rev) OVER (PARTITION BY id) as max_rev\\n      FROM YourTable\\n    ) t\\n  WHERE t.rev = t.max_rev \\nThe other ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION solution already documented in this post isSELECT t.*\\n  FROM\\n    (\\n    SELECT id\\n          ,rev\\n          ,contents\\n          ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY rev DESC) rank\\n      FROM YourTable\\n    ) t\\n  WHERE t.rank = 1 \\nThis 2 SELECT work well on Oracle 10g.MAX() solution runs certainly FASTER that ROW_NUMBER() solution because MAX() complexity is O(n) while ROW_NUMBER() complexity is at minimum O(n.log(n)) where n represent the number of records in table !', 'I like to use a NOT EXIST-based solution for this problem:SELECT \\n  id, \\n  rev\\n  -- you can select other columns here\\nFROM YourTable t\\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (\\n   SELECT * FROM YourTable t WHERE t.id = id AND rev > t.rev\\n)\\nThis will select all records with max value within the group and allows you to select other columns.', 'SELECT *\\nFROM Employee\\nwhere Employee.Salary in (select max(salary) from Employee group by Employe_id)\\nORDER BY Employee.Salary\\n', \"A third solution I hardly ever see mentioned is MySQL specific and looks like this:SELECT id, MAX(rev) AS rev\\n , 0+SUBSTRING_INDEX(GROUP_CONCAT(numeric_content ORDER BY rev DESC), ',', 1) AS numeric_content\\nFROM t1\\nGROUP BY id\\nYes it looks awful (converting to string and back etc.) but in my experience it's usually faster than the other solutions. Maybe that just for my use cases, but I have used it on tables with millions of records and many unique ids. Maybe it's because MySQL is pretty bad at optimizing the other solutions (at least in the 5.0 days when I came up with this solution).One important thing is that GROUP_CONCAT has a maximum length for the string it can build up. You probably want to raise this limit by setting the group_concat_max_len variable. And keep in mind that this will be a limit on scaling if you have a large number of rows.Anyway, the above doesn't directly work if your content field is already text.

Always include a warmup phase which runs your test kernel all the way through, enough to trigger all initializations and compilations before timing phase(s). (Fewer iterations is OK on the warmup phase. The rule of thumb is several tens of thousands of inner loop iterations.) Always run with -XX:+PrintCompilation, -verbose:gc, etc., so you can verify that the compiler and other parts of the JVM are not doing unexpected work during your timing phase. Print messages at the beginning and end of timing and warmup phases, so you can verify that there is no output from Rule 2 during the timing phase. Be aware of the difference between -client and -server, and OSR and regular compilations. The -XX:+PrintCompilation flag reports OSR compilations with an at-sign to denote the non-initial entry point, for example: Trouble$1::run @ 2 (41 bytes). Prefer server to client, and regular to OSR, if you are after best performance. Be aware of initialization effects. Do not print for the first time during your timing phase, since printing loads and initializes classes. Do not load new classes outside of the warmup phase (or final reporting phase), unless you are testing class loading specifically (and in that case load only the test classes). Rule 2 is your first line of defense against such effects. Be aware of deoptimization and recompilation effects. Do not take any code path for the first time in the timing phase, because the compiler may junk and recompile the code, based on an earlier optimistic assumption that the path was not going to be used at all. Rule 2 is your first line of defense against such effects. Use appropriate tools to read the compiler's mind, and expect to be surprised by the code it produces. Inspect the code yourself before forming theories about what makes something faster or slower. Reduce noise in your measurements. Run your benchmark on a quiet machine, and run it several times, discarding outliers. Use -Xbatch to serialize the compiler with the application, and consider setting -XX:CICompilerCount=1 to prevent the compiler from running in parallel with itself. Try your best to reduce GC overhead, set Xmx(large enough) equals Xms and use UseEpsilonGC if it is available. Use a library for your benchmark as it is probably more efficient and was already debugged for this sole purpose. Such as ,  or .  \", 'I know this question has been marked as answered but I wanted to mention two libraries that help us to write micro benchmarks', \"Important things for Java benchmarks are:\\n\\n\\nSystem.gc()gc()\\n\\nI'm just in the process of blogging about the design of a benchmarking framework in .NET.

Certainly worth a look.The jmh is a Java harness for building, running, and analysing nano/micro/macro benchmarks written in Java and other languages targetting the JVM.Very interesting pieces of information buried in .See also:\\n\\n\\n', 'Should the benchmark measure time/iteration or iterations/time, and why?It depends on  you are trying to test.  If you are interested in , use time/iteration and if you are interested in , use iterations/time.', 'If you are trying to compare two algorithms, do at least two benchmarks for each, alternating the order.  i.e.:for(i=1..n)\\n  alg1();\\nfor(i=1..n)\\n  alg2();\\nfor(i=1..n)\\n  alg2();\\nfor(i=1..n)\\n  alg1();\\nI have found some noticeable differences (5-10% sometimes) in the runtime of the same algorithm in different passes..Also, make sure that  is very large, so that the runtime of each loop is at the very least 10 seconds or so.  The more iterations, the more significant figures in your benchmark time and the more reliable that data is.', 'Make sure you somehow use results which are computed in benchmarked code. Otherwise your code can be optimized away.', \"There are many possible pitfalls for writing micro-benchmarks in Java.First: You have to calculate with all sorts of events that take time more or less random: Garbage collection, caching effects (of OS for files and of CPU for memory), IO etc.Second: You cannot trust the accuracy of the measured times for very short intervals.Third: The JVM optimizes your code while executing. So different runs in the same JVM-instance will become faster and faster.My recommendations: Make your benchmark run some seconds, that is more reliable than a runtime over milliseconds. Warm up the JVM (means running the benchmark at least once without measuring, that the JVM can run optimizations). And run your benchmark multiple times (maybe 5 times) and take the median-value. Run every micro-benchmark in a new JVM-instance (call for every benchmark new Java) otherwise optimization effects of the JVM can influence later running tests. Don't execute things, that aren't executed in the warmup-phase (as this could trigger class-load and recompilation).\", \"It should also be noted that it might also be important to analyze the results of the micro benchmark when comparing different implementations. Therefore a  should be made.This is because implementation A might be faster during most of the runs of the benchmark than implementation B. But A might also have a higher spread, so the measured performance benefit of A won't be of any significance when compared with B.So it is also important to write and run a micro benchmark correctly, but also to analyze it correctly.\", 'To add to the other excellent advice, I\\'d also be mindful of the following:For some CPUs (e.g. Intel Core i5 range with TurboBoost), the temperature (and number of cores currently being used, as well as thier utilisation percent) affects the clock speed. Since CPUs are dynamically clocked, this can affect your results. For example, if you have a single-threaded application, the maximum clock speed (with TurboBoost) is higher than for an application using all cores. This can therefore interfere with comparisons of single and multi-threaded performance on some systems. Bear in mind that the temperature and volatages also affect how long Turbo frequency is maintained.Perhaps a more fundamentally important aspect that you have direct control over: make sure you\\'re measuring the right thing! For example, if you\\'re using System.nanoTime() to benchmark a particular bit of code, put the calls to the assignment in places that make sense to avoid measuring things which you aren\\'t interested in. For example, don\\'t do:long startTime = System.nanoTime();\\n//code here...\\nSystem.out.println(\"Code took \"+(System.nanoTime()-startTime)+\"nano seconds\");\\nProblem is you\\'re not immediately getting the end time when the code has finished. Instead, try the following:final long endTime, startTime = System.nanoTime();\\n//code here...\\nendTime = System.nanoTime();\\nSystem.out.println(\"Code took \"+(endTime-startTime)+\"nano seconds\");\\n', ' Java Micro Benchmark - control tasks required to determine the comparative performance characteristics of the computer system on different platforms.

The last line of the output confirms that the database server has dropped the table.It's important to notice that during the INSERT operation the application isn't checking the input for any special characters, and is therefore allowing arbitrary input to be entered into the SQL command. This means that a malicious user can insert, into a field normally intended for user input, special symbols such as quotes along with arbitrary SQL code to cause the database system to execute it, hence .The result?SQL injection is the database equivalent of a remote  vulnerability in an operating system or application.  The potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack cannot be underestimated--depending on the database system and application configuration, it can be used by an attacker to cause data loss (as in this case), gain unauthorized access to data, or even execute arbitrary code on the host machine itself.As noted by the XKCD comic, one way of protecting against SQL injection attacks is to sanitize database inputs, such as by escaping special characters, so that they cannot modify the underlying SQL command and therefore cannot cause execution of arbitrary SQL code.  If you use parameterized queries, such as by using SqlParameter in ADO.NET, the input will, at minimum, be automatically sanitized to guard against SQL injection.However, sanitizing inputs at the application level may not stop more advanced SQL injection techniques. For example, mysql_real_escape_string. For added protection, many database systems support .

Combined with the ; character to end the statement, an attacker can now add whatever sql they want.

Don't hardcode the constant value of E_ALL, because that value is subject to change between different versions of PHP.Loaded configuration is either your loaded php.ini file or your apache.conf or httpd.conf or virtualhost file. Those files are only read once during the startup stage (when you first start apache httpd or php-fpm, for example) and only overridden by runtime configuration changes. Making sure that display_errors = 1 and error_reporting = -1 in your loaded configuration file ensures that you will never see a  regardless of syntax or parse error that occur before a runtime change like ini_set('display_errors', 1); or error_reporting(E_ALL); can take place.To locate your loaded configuration file(s) just create a new PHP file with only the following code...<?php\\nphpinfo();\\nThen point your browser there and look at  and , which are usually at the top of your phpinfo() and will include the absolute path to all your loaded configuration files.If you see (none) instead of the file, that means you don't have a php.ini in . So you can  and copy that to your configuration file path as php.ini then make sure your php user has sufficient permissions to read from that file. You'll need to restart httpd or php-fpm to load it in. Remember, this is the  php.ini file that comes bundled with the PHP source. So please don't use it in production!This really is the best way to avoid a WSOD in development. Anyone suggesting that you put ini_set('display_errors', 1); or error_reporting(E_ALL); at the top of your PHP script or using .htaccess like you did here, is not going to help you avoid a WSOD when a syntax or parse error occurs (like in your case here) if your loaded configuration file has display_errors turned off.Many people (and stock installations of PHP) will use a production-ini file that has display_errors turned off by default, which typically results in this same frustration you've experienced here. Because PHP already has it turned off when it starts up, then encounters a syntax or parse error, and bails with nothing to output.
